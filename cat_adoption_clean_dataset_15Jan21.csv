0,0,Stone,Affectionate and Playful,"*Please note Stone has time remaining in foster care, this is a pre-adoption*
Meet Stone,
Stone is a handsome boy with the sweetest personality you could want!
Stone is a gentle natured boy who adores human attention. He is a quiet sensitive soul so he does take a little time to warm up but once he is settled, he will be your shadow and best friend. His favourite activities are wrestling his brothers and climbing up and down the cat tower on repeat. This sweet boy has such a loving soul despite his initial shyness when first meeting new people. Little Stone just wants to be your best friend and shadow, and will be the most loyal lifelong companion who will cuddle up in bed with you any chance he can; you'll never have an empty lap with Stone around. 
Stone is a sweet, affectionate and joyful little man who craves company, and it is due to this he will need to be adopted with one of his brothers as he heavily dislikes other cats. He would be alright with a household with older children and no dogs.

1,1,Bart & Lisa,Affectionate and Playful,"*This is a pre-adoption, Bart and Lisa have time remaining in foster care*
Meet Bart and Lisa,
Bart is a brown and white tabby king and Lisa is a tabby queen!
Bartholemew, known as Bart, El Barto, Barty Boxtrot or The Bartarino to his friends, is a delicate little picture of perfect manners to cats and humans alike. Barts a tiny nobleman. He likes to be chauffeured from place to place in your arms, constant cuddles, and has the softest fur known to humankind. Dont let his gentlemanly countenance fool you - he still gets bouts of playful zooms, and is perhaps one of the clumsiest cats ever seen.
Then theres Lisa. While Barts the face of the operation, Lisas the brains. Shes a small burst of energy contained in kitten form. Lisa is a pouncer, a little busy body and just loves to play! If theres something to investigate, Lisa will be there. If theres a fly in the house, Lisa will chase it. If there is anything new whatsoever, she will sniff it, then sniff it again to be sure. Her loves include her brother Bart, any adult cat, having her little belly rubbed, and snuggles.
Together, this dynamic duo with matching stamps of a swirl on their fur and complementary personalities bring life and constant entertainment into any home theyre in.

Once hes finished his playing he loves to just take up a spot on his foster mums lap and fall asleep with his engine roaring. He just wants to be your best friend and shadow.

A household with gentle older children would be suitable for him.

Meet Wyatt,
He is a lovingly gentle giant!
Wyatt is such a calm, affectionate and tender soul who just wants to be as close to people as possible. He is the quiet achiever of his litter of 4, being the only boy. He loves nothing more than to snuggle up with his foster mum and be cradled like a baby in her arms, and to be hot on her heels always like a shadow. Wyatt loves to run wild with his siblings, playing tag, wrestling or even just chewing their tail as all siblings do. Kisses are an essential part of his daily routine whenever you are free, and even when your busy he makes sure to shower you with kisses and nuzzles to remind you he's there. Heartbreaker, total sweetheart and a ladies man are a few ways to describe this incredible boy. He will make the most amazing lifelong companion. When first meeting new people he can be quite reserved and shy, but given time he does get comfortable.
Wyatt has a laid back, loving and joyous temperament which shines bright in his foster home. He will need a family that is willing to help his confidence grow and that has patience.

He's had a rough start to life being born on the streets until he came into our care earlier this year and fostered.  Within a short time, he has gone from being unable to be touched to loving his back and neck scratches.   He'll reach out with his paw when his foster mum stops the pats, asking for more.  When being patted, he purrs loudly showing his appreciation.
Frankie's new home will need to have a hooman experienced with shy cats and patient as he continues his development.  
He would be best suited to a home without young children as he does get easily frightened.
From his days on the streets, Frankie is FIV+ meaning he needs to be kept contained indoors and even better, if he has an outdoor cat run as well as he does enjoy spending time outside.

10,10,Bobby and Shelly,Double the Love,"** Please ensure you read this profile in full before enquiring. **
Bobby & Shelly, a double bundle of cuteness and curiosity. 
Bobby is a happy cat that loves a pat, bum scratch and playing with his favourite toys. Hell often make his way onto your bed in the mornings looking for a chin scratch. Bobby is a confident cat but will need some time to adjust to his new surroundings and doesnt like forced interactions. When hes ready for attention hell let you know. 
Shelly is a young cat that is still learning to come out of her shell but loves to play with Bobby and explore her surroundings. She is very energetic and will spend hours chasing her favourite toys (and sometimes Bobby!).  Shelly is still very wary and learning to trust humans. She is very timid and doesnt enjoy pats just yet, but her friend Bobby is showing her the ropes and bringing her slowly out of her shell. Shelly has suspected case of severe asthma and as such can be heard coughing from time to time.  She is currently using a slow feeder so that she doesnt inhale her food or steal Bobbys before hes had a chance to eat!
These cats love their food, and youll often hear them chirping to each other and playing after they nap the day away!  They love exploring and finding their hiding spots but will happily come out to play when theyre ready.
Bobby and Shelly will need a lot of patience as they are wary of new surroundings and people at first. Both can play a little rough so would be best suited to a house with no small children, a home that can respect their boundaries, and provide them with an indoor lifestyle. Currently they would prefer to be the only pets in the home.
Bobby and Shelly are located in Bentleigh.

11,11,Mimi,Curious and friendly,"Hi, I am Mimi! I am a 3y.o. stunner who is looking for her forever home - is it with you?
I am a fluffy gal, quite acrobatic at times (with mixed results) and I LOVE being around my fave people.
Whatever you are up to, I am keen to be involved! I enjoy snuggling up on your lap (or laptop/keyboard), watching tv, and sleeping. When I'm relaxing, I usually like to stay in the same room as my human, just to y'know, keep one eye on you, and keep the other eye staring at the world outside the window.
I enjoy my food and treats...maybe a touch too much. Okay I admit, I could lose a few grams (well that's what the vet said anyway) and I might need your help with this. I am great around new people and visitors but I haven't had much time around kids, although older kids would probably be acceptable (only if they provide lots of gentle pats).
I can be quite playful and love a good piece of string to attack, a box to jump in and balls to chase. After I am worn out, a solid snooze in the sun is ideal.
Ideally I am the only pet in the house because let's face it, I need to be the sole recipient of everyones love and attention. My ideal home would be with someone who is home most of the time (but not essential), given how social I am. I really do love my people! 
Preferably you have a secure outside area, but this is not a requirement. I am very curious about the outdoors but my foster carer has not been successful with getting me into a harness for safe exploring.
I am a healthy and happy girl looking for my FURever home, could this be with you?

Sandy & Rita are sweet girls who would love a chance to have a special home of their own. 
They came to us from a property where they were being hand-fed by the workers. 
We believe Rita is Sandy's mama.  
As they had only had minimal human interaction they have adapted really well to positive interaction with humans. 
They are still a bit shy but will accept pats and rub around your legs, are very inquisitive and can be picked up. 
They are very food orientated and will eat anything you put down for them. 
They may hide when they go to a new home but that is normal for any cat that changes to a new environment with new sounds, smells and new people. 
Rita has been the more confident of the two since they have been in care 
They have not been around dogs or children. They have been ok with other cats that were part of their colony but we can't say how they would interact with ones they don't know. 
A quiet, patient household would be the best for these girls so they can settle into their new life at their own pace.  They might never be cats to sit on your lap but that doesn't mean 
that they wont show you love. 
Both these beautiful girls need a patient home who understands where they have come from and how far they have come along. 
They need an owner who will give them all the time they need to properly settle into their new home.

17,17,Texas STA008721,Looking for love,"Texas came to us from a colony of cats. He was not use to humans, and certainly did not trust us. Shelter life was not for him, so we put him in foster. With long term foster he is learning to trust, and Texas is now enjoying playing with his foster mum. Texas is still gaining his trust of humans, but we feel its his time to go that final step with his forever home.
He is quite playful, and catch and stealing the toys is definitely high on his agenda. Food is a big winner, and will sit for treats from your hand, but sometimes your fingers might get in the road.
He is not an aggressive cat, but learning to play with a human rather than a cat, is something he is still learning. He is still not overly fond of being picked up, but if he does want a cuddle, he will smooch your legs, and a quick big purring cuddle is what you will get.
Texas will do well in a quite home, with a confident feline friend, and has lived comfortably with a dog. If you are happy to have a companion, who will keep you entertained, but will take time to adjust, Texas is a beautiful boy. He is definitely worth the time and effort.

I would love to live in a calm and quiet environment, as that would help keep me feeling safe and secure. I'd be best suited to a household with adults, as younger kids would be too overwhelming.
I've got a couple of things in my medical history that my RSPCA friends would be more than happy to chat with you about.

Tom is a country boy and as everyone knows country boys are tough and dont cry, they just pull themselves together and get on with it, and thats exactly what he has done.
We dont know anything about Toms life before he came to us but he is a battler, he arrived requiring major dental work, some lumps, bumps and abrasions on his body and an injury to his front right leg that was causing him chronic pain. His dental work required two operations and then a third to amputate the leg.
At 10 years old he has been through a lot but he has done it with grace and dignity, and is now ready to find his very own indoor only home. Toms needs are far from outrageous, a warm bed, humans to love and a bottomless food bowl.

Im a man who loves the quiet life. Im seeking an adults-only home where I can relax in peace and spend my days hanging with my humans. Loud noises do tend to startle me and its not uncommon for me to hide under a blanket when Im feeling a little unsure. However, when I am comfortable I am the sweetest and most affectionate boy around.
A few medical bits  I am FIV (feline immunodeficiency virus) positive, meaning I should be the only animal in the home and remain indoors. Not to worry though, I can still live a perfectly normal and healthy life. Ive also been treated for some skin allergies during my time at Lort Smith. It is believed this was due to insect bites, so keeping on top of my flea treatments is a must. Currently I am not receiving any further treatment for this, however there is a chance I may need medication in the future if my allergies flare up again.

42,42,Handsome Milo,Sweet confident boy!,"Milo is looking for his perfect home!
Sweet Milo is a complicated boy who is looking for his perfect forever home on a foster to adopt arrangement. 
Milo came to us after being surrendered to the pound around 5 years of age. It is understood that he was with the same family for his whole life until surrender. Unfortunately, Milo has taken the change in his circumstances very hard and is still struggling to adjust to living in his new foster home. 
As Milos trust was broken, we would like to move him to his permanent home for the remainder of his rehabilitation. We are concerned that while he has really started to settle down in the last few weeks, if he builds a strong bond with his foster family and then is moved again, this will cause more damage to his ability to trust in humans.
Milo is a sweet boy who does like to be around his humans and companionship. Since being in care Milo has learnt to walk on a harness, allowing him to have some outside time safely.  Milo will ultimately need a home where they are committed to taking him for a walk on his harness, or they have a very secure cat run for him to visit in during the day. 
Milo can be an affectionate boy, and he needs an understanding family who is willing to spend the time with him to build a relationship based on trust. As Milo is foster to adopt, he will remain under Found Hearts care medically until he is ready for adoption. He is fully vet worked, desexed, microchipped and vaccinated and has no known health issues, however we will cover the costs if one should arise.
If you believe you can provide Milo with the second chance that he deserves in life please complete the following application:

That sure is true for this precious gal! Petunia's leg has finally healed and she has been cleared to find her furever home. She's ready to show her new family all of the new skills she's picked up now that she's pain-free!
Petunia is around 1 year old and is an incredibly sweet gal who has learned that humans aren't so scary; they are actually quite useful tools when it comes to getting pampered. She will probably be a bit scared at first in her new environment, but she should warm up and treat you to all the snuggles. She is very food motivated so giving her many treats should help to win her over!
Petunia is very playful! She is still young, but she is also making up for lost time while she was dealing with her broken leg. She was pretty playful before her surgery, but being able to move more freely after surgery has unlocked more playing powers! She really is quite a treat to watch when she's in full play mode.
When she first came into our care, she really latched on to the other cats so we do believe that having at least one feline friend will make her happy. She should be okay with kids so long as they can give her time to warm up. She is still getting used to being handled so she doesn't love being held very much but will happily accept pats for hours! She hasn't had much experience with dogs but if they are fairly relaxed, we think she should be able to adjust.

Missy is beautiful approx 8 year old Female Domestic Short Hair. 
Missy is looking for a special home who is able to care for her special needs as Missy is blind. To the best of our knowledge, Missy was born without eyes. She was surrendered to us as her elderly owner could no longer care for her. She spent her days following him around the back yard while he pottered in the garden and had her way around the house memorized to be able to get around quite well! 
Since coming to SMART, Missy has had some surgery to clean and close up the empty eye sockets as they were getting very weepy. She has just had her stiches removed and is now ready to find her new forever family!
This sweet natured girl is looking for a quiet home with no small children. 
Here is what Missy's foster mum has to say about her. 
Missy Moo is the sweetest little lady. She may have no eyes but she doesnt let that stop her. She will hide a little to begin with and then again once she gets a bit nervous. Missy adores cuddles and pats and will sit on your lap all day long if you let her. She needs time to adjust to her new world and will need her new owners to understand this and give her time to settle in. She is toilet trained and has had no accidents. She has no trouble with her appetite and her favourite place to sit is on the window ledge inside with the window open and the sun on her face. Given the chance Missy will make some one a very special and loved family member.

https://www.victoriandogrescue.org.au/about-vicdrg/adoption-and-foster-application-forms.html
Victorian Dog Rescue has a six-week full refund policy and a lifetime takeback guarantee that includes 50 per cent of the adoption fee refunded.
Milly needs someone to love and to be loved.
Milly is an exceptionally, shy girl and needs a quiet home, where her people will allow her time to settle and adjust, without expectation of her. When the time is right, she needs a family who will help her come out of herself, help her build confidence and an understanding that the world is a good place to be.
Milly came to us with many health issues. She lost her kittens and nurtured another litter before joining us and was quite traumatised. She nearly died initially and spent weeks boarding at a specialist health centre.
Whilst in our care, Milly has shown some interest in a young, male, cat and we feel a quiet, gentle, male, feline may be good for her. Her ideal home will be where someone is home a lot of the time, allowing her to familiarise to her new surroundings and gradually build trust. She is not suited to a family with children. She is litter trained.
Update: It has been slow but Milly has made progress. She will play with her toys, enjoys grooming herself and whereas she used to sleep in her cat cave bed, she now sleeps in a flat cat bed on the lounge. Milly looks more relaxed these days and definitely has come out of her shell however she is still very nervous and hides except for meals when her carer is home.
It is a big challenge to help a traumatised cat heal and will require giving Milly the time, space and safe environment she needs. Each seemingly small step of progress is really a huge step in the improvement of Milly's quality of life. Milly will need a nurturing, patient person. Is that you?

At this stage we feel an adult only household or a family with older kids in a quiet, calm home would be great for Frankie. She would do well being rehomed with another cat, she hasn't had any exposure to dogs.

*Jaele has been in care a long time and because she is such special needs we would also be interested in someone willing to take her for set periods to give her carer a break.
Jaele is a friendly, gentle girl who enjoys the company of her dog and cat housemates, but is also happy to spend time by herself on a sunny windowsill. She would also be content as an only pet, but we think her friendly nature means she would prefer some human company. 
Also, Jaele was born with a medical condition which means she needs help with toileting. She needs to have her bladder/bowels expressed two or three times a day. She is quite used to this, never having known anything else, and with some simple training, this condition can be easily managed by a dedicated human.   Her bowels also mean that she leaves little pellets like a rabbit  with the right diet again this can be managed.
Jaeles toileting needs mean that she really needs a home where a human is home for a good amount of time each day, so she would be perfectly suited to retired a person, someone who works from home, or anyone who is home for long periods. She loves human company and interaction, and has even learned to high-five with her humans.
Luckily, she loves cuddles and is very happy sitting on the couch next to any human willing to give her a head rub. She is quite the athlete, and can easily scale a garden fence, climb a tree, jump onto a bench    She would love to have a safe outdoor area but can never be allowed loose anywhere unsafe as she would die a horrible death as a stray with her condition
She loves to play chase games with cat toys and torchlight beams, and will sleep pretty much anywhere, by herself or close to humans. 
All that play works up an appetite for a young girl, and Jaele loves her food, so we recommend close monitoring of food bowls if other cats are fed, as she is known to search out leftovers and may overeat if left to her own devices.
Jaeles foster family describe her as a really special young cat, full of affection and playful energy, but happy to give everyone their space .... the perfect companion for understanding humans.   But that human must understand they are taking on a special needs cat.
Jaele is looking for a really special person.

Check out this adorable video of Orlando!
https://youtu.be/ysvvHC7FIAc
Congratulations Orlando!
Orlando has now graduated from foster care, finishing school!
Orlando enjoys human interaction  he loves cuddles, laps, pats.  We are still working on his being held - he can be picked up and moved, but he is still not comfortable with being held.  He loves nothing more than to curl up and snooze in his carers lap.
Orlando loves human interaction so much; he has a couple of funny traits:
	In the morning, as he does not know which he wants more, his breakfast or some pats and head bumps, he runs between the two  a bite to eat and then he runs, rubs against his carers legs and then back to the bowl for another bite.
	As his carer goes up the stairs he will flop down on every tread, in front of her, to ensure he gets a pat on each one.
	He will flop on the floor and roll, right in his carers pathway, to ensure he gets her attention and gets a touch (even if it is simply a gentle push to move him out of the way!)
Orlando is still a little shy with strangers, however, give him a little space and the rattle of the treat bag and it takes all of 3 minutes before he will venture out to say hello.
Orlando is a friendly, playful cat, who gets along with the other cats in his foster carers home.  We do believe he has probably lived on his own in the past and had to make his own fun, as he is happy to play alone with his toys.  Although we feel he will be best suited to life with another friendly cat, the cat will need to be confident, as Orlando plays enthusiastically and fast.
The ideal home for Orlando will be with an experienced cat person, who will understand how to further develop his confidence.  It will be an adult only home or with a teenaged family.  Orlando would love it if his people were home a lot of the time.
Orlando is such a smoochy boy; he just needs a smoochy family.  Is that you?

Jaffa is a sweet, shy girl. She will rub up against you when she wants some attention and is quite partial to a chin scratchy. Jaffa can be jumpy with noises and would suit a quiet household.

A mature gentleman, but a kitten at heart!
Catthew is the perfect combination of independent and adorable. Youll instantly fall for Catthews sweet face and lovable personality. He is a handsome, mellow boy, who will win the hearts of his forever family.
This gentleman enjoys time sitting high up on the ledges of the cat tree or lying in the sun under a window and watching the world outside. He doesnt like to be picked up, however, Catthew enjoys neck rubs and scratches under the chin, provided he's in the mood.
And when the kitten in him appears, he likes the toy on a stick, or the laser pointer; it's beautiful to see his playful side
He is a character who knocks on doors, so his carer can open them for him. He loves yoghurt and appears instantly his carer sits down with some. He sits next to her and stares, with a cute face, indicating he would like some and of course, he always gets a little. He talks to his carer when he wants something.
Catthew likes his space, but he is such a sweetheart and loving in his own way. He always greets his carer in the morning and rubs against her legs to say good morning.
He needs a patient person or family, willing to give him the time he needs to develop trust and settle. He is not demanding and is a pleasure to have around. Catthew would prefer a quiet home with no young children and, although he is currently sharing a house with other cats, we suspect he would prefer the house to himself.
If you are looking for a feline friend to simply be there, then Catthew is possibly the boy for you.

Did you know that cats purring can be medically therapeutic, lowering stress in humans? Doctor Hetty at your service.  On seeing her carers Hetty starts to purr in readiness for some cat cuddles. 
Hetty is a sweet older lady and all she wants is the simple life. She loves her food, sleeping on her cat tree, sitting on the window sill watching the world go by and some human cuddles. Currently Hetty is fostered with other cats and dogs and shes not interested in them. She is quite happy if they ignore her.
Everyone who meets Hetty says she is a lovely cat. When she came to us from the pound, her mouth was all infected and swollen. Even in that discomfort Hetty was bright and enjoying her food. Shes since had her teeth removed and her coat is looking much better.  She seems to have had it tough but shes taken it all in her stride. Hetty gets a glowing report from her foster carer, who says that she will make a delightful, loving, well behaved companion to her adopter.
We so want Hetty to get the loving home shes always deserved. If you think thats you, please fill out the application.
Hetty is litter trained.

https://www.victoriandogrescue.org.au/about-vicdrg/adoption-and-foster-application-forms.html
Hanna is an affectionate young cat, who loves company. Hanna has come a long way in her progress, initially she was so shy and nervous and now she is very social and affectionate.
This is a little girl with a lot of personality. If you say something to Hanna she mews back, so you can have conversations with her, shes very agreeable. She loves being touched and patted but not being carried around any more than a few seconds. So you can pick her up and put her in the carrier or in another room fine, any longer she wants down. 
Hanna was separated from a cat she was bonded with, and doesnt like being alone. She would suit someone who is home a lot or to be in a two cat home. Her carer says she is such a sweet girl, shell follow you around the house checking up on you. Shell lie on her back on her carers lap and grab the carers hand and pull it down to her face and cuddle the carers wrist with her front legs. 
She doesnt play a lot but when she does she has a ribbon and a penguin wobbler that are her favourite toys. We think she perhaps played more with her former cat companion.
Hanna doesnt fit the aloof cat stereotype, she is very affectionate and social. She is such a good looking cat, isnt that the cutest little pink nose and mouth? 
Hanna likes to sleep in her cat cave bed, she likes to have a few litter tray spots to choose from, she loves cuddles. She does get nervous around loud noises, so a quiet household would suit best. Looking for a sweet bundle of love? Please fill out the application form.

I live with 3 cattle dogs and about 12 other cats and kittens so I'd say I am pretty pet friendly. If I'm not playing with them I really like toys to play with or you. I enjoy company and will follow you around the house.

We decided to try Munch with a new friend, thus being Little Ginger Maverick (3 months old). 
WELL Munch has come a long way thanks to Maverick. They love playing, sleeping, eating and cleaning each other, together. Munch has become more kitten like again and confident. He is 5 years old. 
Maverick is a snuggle bug and a big purr baby. He loves playing with everything. 
Munch and Maverick are bonded and need to be together. 
Without Maverick, Munch wouldnt be where he is today. He enjoys peoples company and gives great head butts.

101,101,Maurice (Located in Sandringham),Purrfect Companion,"Are you looking for a companion cat? If you are looking for a gentle, peaceful cat, then let me tell you about Maurice. 
He is a gentle, home-body cat who is sometimes happy to sit on the arm of your chair, or at the foot of the bed at night. He loves to curl up and have alone time as well.
Maurice loves to bask on the balcony, but is a total indoor cat. Maurice uses his cat scratcher post every day and is quiet. 
He lived with a young dog, and a younger cat for about 4 years, and was not at all fussed. They often slept in the same bed.
Maurice came to me from one of my adult children who moved interstate. I now am returning to travelling work, and cannot take him with me.
He has sometimes been cared for at home by a once-a-day cat carer, so he can handle spells without you, but what a welcome when you arrive home!

Dont be backwards in coming forwards either! HE will purr loudly for your attention and will lean in with head bunts every chance he gets.
Short is always up for chasing anything. As the first to explore new areas he is super confident and super alert! You can just picture him out in the jungle sussing out all the sounds and smells of nature! He loves to carry small toys in his mouth, bringing them to his carer as presents, and loves stretching out when  sleeping. Perhaps he is trying to make himself look a little less shorter and a little longer!  
He adores playtime with his brothers and would be great in a home with one of his siblings or existing resident felines, such is his charisma in making friends. 
Short is yet to be tested with dogs but with a very slow structured introduction with a cat friendly dog, we feel things may swim along rather nicely.

In fact, he can often be found asleep on the shoulder of his foster carer or warming her feet/shins after a long day.  
Red loves his food and will definitely let you know when it is meal time!
Red is in care with two siblings, both of whom he adores. Following a busy day of play, he can often be found in the middle of a kitten cuddle puddle. It is for this reason we feel Red would be best suited to a home alongside one of his siblings, Ted or Short. After all, two kittens are always better than one.

105,105,Aurelia (Locate in Clayton),"Chirpy, Happy Furfriend!","Aurelia is timid but a delight and has so many charming little quirks once you get to know her. She was rescued from a farm in the nick of time before becoming pregnant, even though she is pretty much a kitten herself.
Once you break through her initial shyness she is very affectionate, chatting away and chasing that pesky red dot. She has some hilarious traits; sticking her butt in the air, chirping and rolling around on the ground is her default pat sequence. Her head butts are enthusiastic and can make you drop your phone or spill your tea if youre not careful! She loves food and isnt a fussy eater. Her litter tray is very neat.
Aurelia will take about 48 hours to begin to come out of her shell in a quiet home and patience will be required. She is best suited to a quiet house where she could be an only cat or live with furbrothers and fursisters who arent too quiet (so she can learn to be brave from them) or too rowdy (we would worry she will never come out of her shell). Quiet children over 5 years old would be a good fit and we have noticed she takes a lot longer to warm up to men. She is slowly being convinced to use the cat scratchers instead of the carpet and to sleep rather than play at night. Potential adopter need to remember that living inside is all new to her but she is clever and adapting. She is really happy (except when food time is late) to know comfort, safety and where her next meal is coming from and it is heart-warming. Although not quite a lap cat yet, she does like to sit against you. She also doesnt understand cuddles but it seems likely she will grow to love them as she is very affectionate.
You can see what Aurelias been up to on Instagram @jhq_furfoster.

106,106,Shiloh (Located in Southbank),Giant Eyed Princess,"Hi! My name is Shiloh but my foster mom and dad call me Shy Shy and Moo Moo. Despite them trying to confuse me with different names, I'm a smart kitty and come when they call (at least when I'm not too busy messing around with all my toys). 
I overheard my foster parents say that I was mixed up in a ""cat gang"" before they found me. Despite it being rough sometimes, I liked my little crew. I think I would be happy to be in a home with another ""superior being"" like me. I may take my time getting to know them though. Something my old crowd taught me is to never trust too soon and that's what I intend to do! My foster mom says my love is worth the wait. 
I hope you have enough room in your bed because I like to curl up every night under the covers for a cuddle. I dont like it when my foster mom leaves me so I follow her around and yell at her to pay attention to me. I'll even let her pick me up for a cuddle when I'm feeling extra generous. 
My foster parents mentioned I have something called FIV+, but that doesnt stop me! I'm a ball of energy! I particularly like catapulting across the bed and sprinting around the living room. 
What do I do when I'm not running around the house? Giving my foster parents ""head-butts"" to show how much I love them or sleeping next to my foster mom when she works. I dont like being alone so I'm looking for a family who is around most of the time to keep me company. I also love to eat. a lot and I'm not shy about asking for it! All I have to do is look at my foster dad with my ""big eyes"" and he'll do what I say. So easy to bend them to my will!
That's all for now! Maybe we can hang out soon!?
Notes from my foster mom:
	 Shiloh is such a loving cat but you need to give her lots of time to warm up to you. Once she trusts you though, she will not leave you alone! She loves all the attention. She's cuddly and smoochy.
	 Due to her gingivitis, she has only 4 front teeth remaining. This does not stop her from eating and drinking normally. Sometimes her tongue sticks out and it's so adorable!
	 We do ask that you keep her on a balanced raw meat diet (I can provide the brand we use). This is to keep her immune system strong because of her FIV.  We also ask that you dont feed her dry/hard food. Since she only has the front four teeth, dry food will hurt her gums. 
	 She will require one cortisone shot a month to keep her allergies at bay.

Bobtails are known for being great family cats, okay with children and other pets, sweet affectionate and docile  Taylor ticks all of those boxes.
Taylor loves to be near people, although she is not needy.  She is playful and loves pats and will happily sleep on the couch or on the bed.   
Taylor is well socialised and will settle into any home easily. She will be best suited to a home where there is company  and the opportunity to spend time outdoors, either a secure backyard or outdoor enclosure. Alternatively, she is good on a harness so that would also be an option to give her some outdoors time. Having been around kittens and another adult cat, Taylor would love to have the company of other friendly cats or a dog. Taylor would not be suited to a single cat home
Taylor is a petite girl and doesnt require a special diet.  Her main source of food is dry, however will eat some wet food at times.

She is a special girl, looking for a special home.

A little unfriendly at first these boys have thrived in foster care. They have been raised around cats and big dogs; normal household noises and with a lot of love. 
They have grown into adorable, snuggly, loving kittens. They love to play and love to be in laps; or in bed with their foster carers. 
When snuggling with you their purr button is usually on! 
They are litter trained, love Royal Canin kitten food, Blackhawk kitten biscuits and roast chicken. If you like chicken yourself you might need to fight them off; they like to share their foster Mums dinner. They have been known to enjoy a sneaky piece of ham too. 
If you are looking for a beautiful little boy to share your life with, these guys are just the ticket. 
Note: they have been raised together but can quite happily go to separate homes.

Kaida is smoochy and sweet with people that she trusts, she's quite nervous at times and so having strange people reach out to her is very scary to her. With people that she knows she will approach on her own and head bump and rub against them to her hearts content, but still sometimes get a bit jumpy if they make any sudden movements or try to touch her in a way that she isn't comfortable with. So for this reason she is need of an experienced owner and a quiet home.
Her ideal family will let her come out of her shell at her own pace and respect her boundaries, she loves her food and her favourite thing to do is roll around in her blankets.

Barney is good with kids, although like most cats can sometimes get a bit rough when playing. Barney was surrendered through no fault of his own, he is a cat that craves attention and would love a family with plenty of time to dedicate to him.
Barney enjoys meeting new people however he is less charismatic with other felines.

115,115,Chris,Green eyed cuddler!,"These beautiful boys (named after the hosts of Ink Master) were born in the back of a garage. The owner of the property contacted us to see if we could rescue them; which we of course did. They have been in foster care since they were approximately 4 weeks old. 
A little unfriendly at first these boys have thrived in foster care. They have been raised around cats and big dogs; normal household noises and with a lot of love. 
They have grown into adorable, snuggly, loving kittens. They love to play and love to be in laps; or in bed with their foster carers. 
When snuggling with you their purr button is usually on! 
They are litter trained, love Royal Canin kitten food, Blackhawk kitten biscuits and roast chicken. If you like chicken yourself you might need to fight them off; they like to share their foster Mums dinner. They have been known to enjoy a sneaky piece of ham too. 
If you are looking for a beautiful little boy to share your life with, these guys are just the ticket. 
Note: they have been raised together but can quite happily go to separate homes. 
The main difference is that Chris has beautiful green eyes and Ollie has blue eyes (also beautiful).

We are the purrfect couple, Monica and Chandler, and we are looking for our furever home together!
This beautiful duo is looking for a quiet and relaxed home, without any young children. They would be happy in a home with teenage children that respect their space. 
Chandler is a playful lovebug, who loves to run around the house, eat your houseplants when you're not looking, and roll around in the sunshine, showing you his adorable little belly! He's a massive foodie, and loves treats! Chandler enjoys looking out the window, and being stroked. Chandler gets along with both the resident cats and dogs at his foster home. He's a beautiful gentleman, who is looking for a loving and patience home with his lady, Monica.
Monica is a more independent gal. She prefers affection on her own terms, but when she seeks you out, its the best feeling in the world! Monica likes routine, so a peaceful, calm and quiet lifestyle is the dream for her. Much like Chandler eating houseplants, Monica will play with toys when she thinks no one is watching! Monica is unbothered by the resident dog, but she is not fond of any cats that aren't Chandler, so these two will be looking for a home where they are the only cats. She's an extremely sweet cat, who will take some time to adjust, but with someone who is an experienced and patience cat parent, who will become a great companion!
This gorgeous couple is looking for a patient and loving family to join. If you think Chandler and Monica would be a good fit for your family, fill out their application form here!

145,145,Duchess,Sweet & Loving,"Meet Duchess, a pretty wee little girl who is friendly,  quietly confident and affectionate. She loves snuggles and pats. She came into my care 2 days ago with her brothers Chase and Cooper, and settled in immediately, exploring, playing, smooching, purring and using her litter tray with no issues. 
She is the smallest and quietest of her siblings, but don't be fooled, she loves attention! Duchess loves to play and will toss her toys and chase and wrestle with her brothers before curling up in their arms to snooze. She will crawl onto your lap and snuggle up with you, she's happy to be picked up and cradled in your arms, and she'll give you nose kisses and purr loudly. 
Duchess is approximately 5 months old but still very small and has some babyish behaviours. When she's relaxed and purring she may want to gently suckle on your fingers, she will require your care and patience to redirect this behaviour. 
She is very curious about technology, and loves to see what you're doing on your phone or laptop, why you're tapping your fingers on the keyboard, and what's that picture on the screen! She also loves to know what you're drinking, and will dip her paws into your mug if given the chance! 
Like her brother Chase, Duchess has a very soft coat made up of short and medium hair. She has a long fluffy tortoiseshell tail and gorgeous toroiseshell markings on her head and back which contrast beautifully with her snow white coat. She has the sweetest little face and pink nose. Come and meet Duchess and you will fall in love with this precious little angel!
Duchess has briefly met 3 children between the ages 6 - 12. She enjoyed their pats and attention for a short time before preferring to find a safe space where she could watch them play with her brother Cooper. She loves her brothers and would easily settle into a forever home with one of them, or on her own as an indoor cat, ideally with access to an outdoor cat run. Duchess will make a loving companion, or addition to a family with older, gentle children who will respect her boundaries and treat her with lots of gentleness. She has yet to be introduced to dogs or other cats not related to her, but given the right introductions she may settle in ok with an older gentle cat or dog.",Female,Domestic Medium Hair Cat,South Gippsland Animal Aid,"Yarragon, VIC",Medium,"13 Jan, 2022",200.00,5.0,Doesn't have kids under 5

147,147,Gucci ^^Dandy Cat Rescue^^,Precious pretty princess," $280 adoption fee 
Gucci is a kitten who knows her own mind and likes to do things her way at her own speed. Like the designer brand she is named after, Gucci is very exclusive in who she gives her love to. And you need to be ready to take what you are given!
With her very beautiful grey and white coat, Gucci is very much a look but only occasionally touch kind of girl. She will allow herself to be patted - but only when she is in the right mood. Being picked up is barely tolerated and you can forget about her ever sitting on your lap. Social distancing is a way of life for this pretty princess.
Gucci has surrounded herself with other cats and kittens while in our care  she loves a cat audience and will make herself the centre of attention with other felines. Humans are expected to wait in line for their turn to admire her. 
When she is in the mood (usually when she is about to kitten nap or late at night on the bed), Gucci will allow herself to be stroked while she falls asleep. Only then will she share her luxurious purr with you. 
Gucci is a very photogenic cat and surprisingly she will happily play while you shoot videos of her. Media attention is something she likes, so if youre thinking of starting a social media account for Gucci she would give that idea the blue tick of approval.
Gucci loves to show off her playing skills and will pounce and prance with toys and the laser light  checking to make sure youre watching as she needs an audience to perform to. 
This diva also expects you to provide her meals on time every time, and it must be food that is to her liking or you will get the haughty glare of disapproval. 
Gucci is untested on dogs and frankly she would think them beneath her. So we are recommending a home with either another cat/cats, or where she is the only cat but will not be expected to shower her humans in love and cuddles. You, however, are free to adore her as much as you like.
If you are looking to adopt a pair of kittens, Gucci is fond of her fellow foster brother Harvey (also listed on Pet Rescue, they are not related). Harvey is her biggest adoring fan and she thinks hes okayish.
Gucci would definitely not enjoy the company of young children and its doubtful if shed like teens much unless they know to give her space when she wants it. Over time Gucci might change her mind and show them love, but it wont happen automatically.

148,148,Cooper,Confident & playful,"Cooper is a very confident and caring teenager who's eager to meet and play with new people, including children over 5. He will play for hours, with his toys, with you, and with his siblings. And when he's exhausted he will flop down beside you and rest his head on your leg or your shoulder. He's a purr machine and loves pats. 
He won't take long to claim you as his own, and when he does you can expect kisses, head boops and snuggles, and will happily allow you to pick him up and carry him around in your arms. He will even attempt to groom you! 
He's very enquisitive and mischievious, fascinated by the shower and the bathtub, whether you're in it or not! So please be careful to empty the tub before leaving the bathroom. He's also keen on close inspection of your own toileting habits, so if you like your privacy you may want to close the door! 
He chirps and trills to get your attention and will look upon you with his loving eyes and gorgeous face. Cooper is such a good looking and good natured boy, with huge almond shaped eyes, sleek physique, long legs, and big feet, he is sure to grow up to be a big boy who will make a fun and loving companion or addition to your family.
Cooper is waiting to meet you and give you all his love and purrs. He would suit an indoor lifestyle with access to a cat run or enclosure. He has already met some children aged 6 - 12 and he played with them immediately, enjoying their attention. He has yet to meet any dogs or other cats not related to him, but he loves his siblings. He is very caring toward his little sister and boisterous and playful with his brother.

He's been in my care for 2 days and already follows me everywhere, including the toilet! 
He has the softest short white coat with a beautiful long fluffy black tail, his markings are incredible and the combo of big white whiskers against his black Batman mask is striking! He looks a lot bigger and older in the photos than what he really is, at approximately 5 months old he's still very young and small but has the benefit of being toilet trained so you won't have to worry about any accidents.

He is a skilled hunter with his toys, so he will need an indoor only lifestyle, ideally with access to an outdoor cat run. He's good with children who are willing to respect his boundaries and be gentle with him. 
Chase loves his siblings, playing, wrestling, snuggling and grooming with them.

Hi, my name is Falcon and I am one of the cutest little kittens you will ever meet. Let me tell you a little about myself. I was found in a park under a slide when I was just 2 weeks old. My foster Mummy put her hand up to look after me because everyone said I was going to die because I was so little and I had a bad case of cat flu. Well clearly people don't know much about the rescue that took me in and mine & my Forster Mummy's determination. My foster Mummy looked after me very very well and the lady that runs the rescue made sure my Foster Mummy had everything she needed to make sure I was given a chance. Well here I am now as cute as ever. I am well and even after we were told my eye would have to be removed I beat that to. Now I sometimes have to have eye ointment but they said my eye will get better. So anyway, given what I have been though I am pretty go lucky type of guy. I love to play and chase other kittens. I absolutely love children and I will chase them if they have toys. So do you think you can handle my Cuteness and understand that maybe sometimes I may need eye ointment? If you want me to come and live with you forever please no excited dogs because I am only use to a chilled dog that respects my personal space.

GDay, my name is Rory and I wanna be your kittys best friend! Oops, I mean, also yours. 
I am a very well-mannered gentleman with loads of qualifications. I never scratch or bite, I never wake you up demanding food, I have impeccable toilet habits, and I will keep your house free of flies always. I am a man of few words but deep thoughts. When I do get very excited, I will let out some happy tiny squeaks. Trust me, its the cutest. 
Psst, heres a question for you, do you have a cat/cats already? Because I LOVE other cats and I get along with cats of all sort of personalities. I will groom them, cuddle with them, be joined at the tail with them. If you have a feline I can make friends with, your instagram is gonna explode. I am not tested with dogs. 
I am an ex street cat and I was really scared and unsure when I first went into foster care. But I opened up really quickly once my foster mum came at me with a treat. Yes, I am that easily bribed. And even though Im not a lap cat, soon enough you will find me coming up to you for pats and snuggles. 
Here are some of my little quirks.  I love a game of tag. Whenever you walk past me, I will put my paw up and tag you. I dont know why I do that, I just like my humans confused face when I do. Round toys are the best, I will carry them in my mouth and sprint around the house to show off. But really what I love most is to nap. Who doesnt?
A few things I dont like: being picked up, belly rubs and Im probably not suitable for kids under 5 who might be very grabby. But other than that, I am a good natured sweet boy with a dash of cheekiness that will fit into most households. Cant wait to go home with your cat, I mean, you as well!

171,171,Malcolm,Looking for love,"Hi! My name is Malcolm!
If you are after a cat who is your shadow, companion, partner in crime, lap warmer and guard dog in a cats body who doesn't actually guard and will hide... Look no further. You have officially found me!
I made my way to the RSPCA after a very long car journey from the RSPCA in South Australia. I was needing a sea-change - I just didn't expect it to be from Foster Care for as long as it has been! 
I am looking for a home with a cat-savvy owner who will appreciate my singing voice and appreciate my need to be around you ALL. THE. TIME. I mean it - I need my humans so much, their love is all that makes me happy in this world. Well, that and toys. But love! All I need is love! I would best suit someone who works from home, or someone retired who is happy lounging the days away with me by their side. Someone who I can give kisses and head boops too with my huge noggin, and appreciate my needy nature. 
I am still living in Foster Care with my amazing Foster Mum because I need that human companionship and my Foster Mummy can give that to me, which keeps me so happy. I do love feline companionship as well and would love a home where I could potentially have a kitty girlfriend to keep me company when you head out to the shops. 
I sadly get anxious if I am left on my own, and my lovely singing voice turns into a very sad crying howl because I just hate hate hate it. I'll make sure you know it too! I need a patient home with no young children, and plenty of routine, stability and not much change. I like familiarity and knowing my place (which will hopefully be glued to your lap). 
I require an indoor lifestyle due to my precious white fur, but that means more time with you, following you... everywhere... even to the toilet if you'll let me. 
I love puzzles and games to keep my anxious mind distracted when you're not around as well, or if you're too warm for my cuddles. 
If you click on that apply button, this may be the start of the most beautiful love story that Taylor Swift would dream to sing about. 
Love,
Malcolm, your big timid polar bear.

Sebastian, or Sebbie, is a cuddly senior ragdoll boy who loves nothing more than to curl up next to you and meow for  attention.  
He can be shy at first and prone to hiding but once he's more comfortable, he is extremely affectionate and is always ready for a belly rub and a head scratch.
Sebbie has lived with a dog and other cats before and would be fine with other docile cats but is untested with more dominant cats.  He would be more than happy to be your only pet though so he doesn't have to share your love and attention.  Sebbie isn't fond of children so it would be best he goes to a home without any young hoomans.
His previous owners have moved into a retirement village and were unable to bring him which is how he came into our care.
Sebbie is in good health but did have crystals approximately 5 years ago so it is highly recommended he stay on a urinary diet food to avoid a recurrence.
He's spent his life as an indoor/outdoor cat and his new home will need a decent sized outdoor cat run/enclosure to keep him happy when he's not snuggled up with you.",Male,Ragdoll Cat,Bast Cat Club,"Clyde, VIC",Medium,"12 Jan, 2022",200,129.0,Doesn't have kids under 5| Doesn't have kids from 6 to 12

Once Kai feels at home, his soft voice and gentle nature combined with his loud purr machine will endear him to any home.  
He is very well behaved and respectful - doesn't make a mess or tear up furniture.  Thunderstorms though are very frightening for him and he'll hide away until it's over.
Kai is good with children and other cats, if you already have a friendly feline or are looking to adopt a brother or sister for him.
During his time on the streets, Kai contracted FIV so he needs to be contained either as an inside only cat or with a secured outdoor run.  His FIV also means he needs to be on a high quality diet (Ziwi Peak dry and wet food) which he loves.
Kai's favourite activities are watching TV with his hoomans, snoozing in his cat castle or sharing his hoomans bed. 
Kai's ideal home is one that understands his needs, have lots of love to give and keep him secure inside and bonus if theres an outdoor cat run.  In return he'll provide endless love, cuddles and loud purrs.",Male,Domestic Short Hair Cat,Bast Cat Club,"Toorak, VIC",Short,"12 Jan, 2022",150,74.0,

203,203,Lily and Guzma,Friendly twosome,"Brief description of personality: Lily is a beautiful and cheeky girl. She is not that phased by human interaction. She is curious and will come take a peak when you open cupboards or the fridge. But won't ask for pats but also won't run away if you gently pat her. She is definitely very fond of Guzma and will always come check on her. And always initiate the affection. Check out the super cute video! She is a picky eater, loves creamy treats in the little sachets but only nibbles on dry food and never finshes her wet food like Guzma does.
Guzma is really affectionate and very curious. Enjoys human attention and interaction. Likes having dry food available so she can help herself whenever she needs. Big fan of warm cat milk as well. Easy going and will hang out with you on the couch. She definitely is more independent and confident with humans than Lily is. As a bonded pair they are super easy going and well balanced.
 They are such beautiful cats and are very well behaved with kids as 
They are both incredibly friendly and relaxed cats. Lilly is a very fussy eater Guzma is great with food. Lily is good with being hand fed her favourite treat
Home Environment: It's best to give them their own space to retreat to away from everything else as they enjoy their solitude. They are comfortable with having each other and have their own beds that they are very used to. They are comfortable in handling themselves around kids and even played with my 3 year old neighbour. Both of them enjoy being hand fed and are very trusting cats

Once you are done staring into my green dreamy eyes, you should give my story a read. 
My name is Oliver and I am a ridiculously handsome young man. Emerald blinkers, a nice pastel coat and an absolutely wonderful personality to match. 
I am a little shy at first but very quickly warm up and I will be your little lovebug. I will meow loudly when I think its time for some cuddles (or a snack) and love hanging out. 
Id love a nice peaceful home where I can relax during the day and give you plenty of cuddles when you are home with me. I have excellent house manners and always go on the toilet. 
I am FIV+ positive, so that means Id have to be a single cat or live with another female positive feline. My foster mum does have a dog, although we havent had the chance to become best of friends, I dont seem to have a huge problem with him. A cat savy calm dog might be okay for me to live with. 
Despite my history of doing it rough on the streets, my foster mum thinks the world of me. I am a super great little lad who is more than deserving of a nice home to call my own. 
I look forward to meeting my new family. Come see me in Clyde.

213,213,Juele ^^Dandy Cat Rescue^^,Long-term foster needed,"***LONG-TERM FOSTER CARER NEEDED, WITH OPTION TO ADOPT***
Life on the streets was pretty tough for Jeuel (pronounced Jewel). At a young age this beautiful dark torti girl found herself alone, scared and a new mother to two kittens. 
Jeuel used all her instincts to survive and keep her kittens alive, and she did it exceptionally well given the very poor circumstances she was living in. She lived in constant fear and food was scarce, so hiding and sneaking about became her survival mechanisms. 
Thankfully we were able to trap this mumma cat and her two kittens and we brought them into care. Things were going well and Jeuel was beginning to adapt but she was momentarily separated from her kittens and she has not forgiven her foster carer for this.

We had been making progress with Jeuel; she was allowing her foster carer to pat her and we even heard her purr! But this minor incident has been a major setback and so we need to find a new carer for Jeuel who can take her to the next level.
Jeuel needs a cat person  someone who can invest the time and patience in showing this girl all the joys people can bring to her life. We are looking for a long-term foster carer with a view to adopting (if requested). 
You will need a quiet home with no other pets, and a kindness in your heart to share with this lovely girl. She needs someone to take a chance on her and show her the way  and we know she will repay you with love by the bucket load. 
We will cover Jeuels vet bills (including her desexing, vaccinations etc) and provide flea and worm treatments for her as well as the support of our team at Dandy Cat Rescue. When possible, will might be able to provide some dry and wet food for Jeuel however you would need to provide the majority of the food for her yourself.
Initially Jeuel would need to stay in a quiet room for a few days before she can explore more of the home. Having her in a confined space would allow you more access to her in the initial phases when you will need to start winning her over. 
Jeuel needs an experienced cat person; someone willing to work with her on a longer-term basis. She will flourish in a quiet environment, one with either no children or older teenage children and a home where she can let her guard down at her own speed. 
Underneath her beautiful fur, Jeuel is a sweetheart who is just waiting for her time to shine. Can you help Jeuel sparkle? Contact us today for a chat.

214,214,Harvey ^^Dandy Cat Rescue^^,Intelligent tuxedo boy," $280 adoption fee 
Harvey is an independent little tuxedo boy who is super smart and a hoot to be around when he is playing. 
Like most tuxedo kittens, Harvey is highly intelligent and works things out really quickly - youll never have to call him twice for meal times or show him where the litter and water are kept more than the first time. 
Harvey comes from a litter of five kittens who were dumped. This has made him highly social with other cats and kittens. But he is not a lap or cuddly cat. 
Harvey is a great companion for other cats and kittens. He is all about sharing his love with other kitties and will happily curl up to sleep with whichever kitty he chooses. And none of them want him to leave. 
Harvey needs a home where he will have a cat and/or small, cat-friendly dog pal to play with. He is not suited to being an only cat or in a home where he will be left alone for long stretches. 
Harvey thrives in company and he will join in on any playing activity  he is hilarious to watch chase the red laser light dot as he will never quit trying to catch it! He will pick up and carry a toy mouse in his mouth like a dog, and his favourite material in the whole world is cardboard. A cardboard box is the peak of all enjoyment in his eyes. 
Harvey has recently learned how nice it is to be patted and cuddled but it is all on his terms - and he has to be in the right mood (usually before bed time!). Otherwise Harvey wants to play more than be loved. 
Harvey is energetic, playful and fun and would be the first to learn tricks if you have the time to teach him. He is a confident boy within himself but needs someone to give him the space he needs to grow at his own pace.

They have been a team for the past 3 years and were allowed supervised outdoor time as well as indoor.  We would recommend a long stint of indoor time before even thinking of supervised outdoor time unless you had a cat enclosure for them (which would be ideal!)  
Bazza is definitely the more outgoing and confident of the pair. 
Mikey frets if Bazza is not there to support him.   Mikey is starting to come become more confident with his foster carers which is great news. 
. 
Bear in mind though a change in environment and people can make cats very shy and they may hide and exhibit behaviours they haven't prior so it is paramount the new owners are patient and understanding of any shyness displayed. 
These boys are still young and, were originally rescues before we took them on so deserve a fresh start where they can grow old together without the worry of having to move on again.

Dallas is an affectionate and cuddly boy who likes to snuggle everywhere, be it on the couch or in the bed. He especially loves to lie down and be brushed, becoming quite the purr machine and would love someone that has time to groom him. Dallas is very playful and at the moment his favourite game is to chase little balls around, especially pom poms are irresistible!.
Linxy is currently still the more cautious one of the pair. She loves to engage in play and that is currently the best way to connect with her. She knows her comfort zone and might give a little hiss to signal her discomfort however, will also sit comfortably around humans that she can trust to know her boundaries and she counts as her family. 
Dallas adores other cats and Linxy is friendly with the others felines too. Both are playful, with toys and also with each other. They both love climbing and scratching posts and sleeping high up on a cat tree. Finally, this pair loves a good chat, and likes to tell how the world works, to their humans and to each other. 
Dallas and Linxy are comfortable with respectful children older that 5yrs that are not loud. Not tested with dogs in foster care.

Herman is a very handsome, suave little gent with the cutest little moustache.  Whilst he may be shy at first, with a few reassuring cuddles, he quickly begins to trust his humans and it is not long before he is following you all around the house observing and supervising the day to day activities within the home.  He doesnt mind a chat and will purr enthusiastically as soon as you engage him in conversation.  He is such a sweet little man who definitely has a cheeky side, bopping some of his housemates on the head while they sleep peacefully.  He is a creature of comfort and will be sure to keep your spot on the couch nice and warm for you for hours on end until its time for you to join him for a snuggle.
Lola, is a beautiful little girl with a luxuriously soft silky coat and signature mascara outline around her eyes.  She is a little more shy than her brother and takes a little while to settle into her surroundings.  She tends to sit back and let her brother do the recon tour of any new environment and once he has completed his mission and given the ok, she will slowly make her way out and explore too.  Despite her shyness at first, make no mistake, this girl absolutely loves pats, cheek rubs and butt scratches on tap, she just needs a little reminding at first.  Once this girl relaxes and lets her guard down, she is an absolute sweetheart.  Now that she has finally found her meow, she will certainly let you know when she is hungry and seems to especially love breakfast time where she will pull out all the stops and mooch all over you until brekkie is served. 
Lola has a beautiful medium hair coat and really enjoys being brushed to help her keep it in great condition.  She loves rubbing her cheeks up against anything and everything.  Christmas is coming and so is Santa and I just know she would absolutely love one of those corner grooming brushes that can be attached to wall corners!
These two play like kittens with each other, rough and tumbling around, chasing and playing with balls, chasing flies  they have energy to burn.  At the end of a very active day they will find a nice cozy spot and sleep most of the night.
Herman and Lola have shared a house with 3 other cats and a friendly dog.  Whilst they have mostly gotten along well with other felines, I believe they will be most happy together as only cats in the household with a family with older children who will understand a little patience will be needed for these two to continue flourish and become the most easy going and happy little lap cats.  They have also had access to a fully enclosed backyard and would enjoy the fresh air when they can in a safe enclosure.
They have not been tested with dogs.

226,226,Mickey Mouse,I love other cats!,"MEET MICKEY!
Mickey/Mickey Mouse/Mousey is a gorgeous approximately 5 months old boy. He is now fully vet worked and ready for his forever home. 
Mickey is a beautiful loving smoocher! He is so affectionate and follows his human around the house, running around your legs and begging for attention. Mickey was originally a gift to an elderly person who unfortunately couldn't care for him, he came to us at approximately 10 weeks old. Mickey has not been around kids and when he was tested with little kids, he was terrified and not appropriate at all so for his happiness we ask that he goes to a home with no little/young kids please (the occasional visitor is okay as long as he has somewhere to hide) He will be shy and nervous to begin with in his new home so please dont expect him to show his true colours immediately, but as soon as you show him some love and affection he will gain trust and become your little shadow! 
Mickey LOVES other cats and would not do well as an only cat, Mickey would make a wonderful companion for another kitten or young, playful cat looking for a mate, or you can adopt him alongside one of the other kittens currently living with him that he already loves. He has been exposed to a large dog and is comfortable as long as the dog is cat-friendly and does not chase him. If you have no other cats, a human must be home to keep Mickey company.
He would love to be able to sleep with his humans in bed and be allowed to follow you around the house as you do your daily duties, he will truly make someone a wonderful best mate, especially someone living alone or a working from home, you will never be alone again with Mickey in the house! Mickey does have a bad habit of giving ""love bites""! When Mickey demands attention, he will bite (gently) on your hand or foot to say HEY! Look at me! This is not an aggressive action, he is just bossy and overly excited about affection especially considering for the first few weeks of his life he had none, he will most likely grow out of this as he settles into his home and realises that his owners aren't going away and the attention will always be available. 
*Mickey is INDOOR ONLY for life please only apply for him if your household is comfortable and capable of this, he would absolutely not do well outside. Please let us know this is okay.
*No little/young kids please, Mickey is skittish to loud noises and quick movements.
*Mickey MUST go to a home with another kitten or young playful friendly cat or adopted alongside one of his foster mates (not currently on petrescue)

Rick is a typical sphynx and loves to be all up in your business all the time and would make a wonderful companion. He deserves to be absolutely spoilt, with lots of opportunities for enrichment and play. Rick would suit a home where he can have lots of love and attention, with someone who is home a lot as he can get lonely and this can be a source of stress for him. With a proper introduction he could probably live with a kitty friend (it may even be beneficial for him!). Rick would best suit a mature home, or one with older children - he has previously lived with a young child and whilst they loved each other it did seem to stress him out a bit.
We are hoping to find hima home with previous sphynx experience, knowledge of the breed and their needs is a must.

Rick is currently doing well onZiwi Peak Lamb wet food, and he uses his litter with no issues.

231,231,Wasabi ^^Dandy Cat Rescue^^,Energetic and adorable," $280 adoption fee 
If you are looking for a very energetic and entertaining kitten who will love you endlessly, then Wasabi is your guy!
Wasabi is a very, very special little guy. We like to think he will go down in history as one of our greatest foster kittens. He really is the complete package!
Wasabi only has two modes - complete relaxation or GO, GO, GO! This playful and adventurous boy is active until he maxes out his energy limit, after which time he will promptly fall asleep.
Wasabi loves to play with all of his toys and will discover anything in the house that he could possibly play with. He loves to watch the TV, particularly the cricket!
Despite his energetic nature, Wasabi is still very respectful of boundaries set by adult cats, so he would be a great addition to a home with a kitty. But Wasabi would be best suited to a cat that is closer to his energy levels!
While Wasabi does love to play with other kittens, he is very good at entertaining himself. 
If you are looking for an only-cat, Wasabi would need to be with a couple or a family that is home a lot because he isn't used to being by himself. Being alone for long periods is not good for this boy as he craves company, attention and interaction. He will cry when there is no-one around. 
 
Wasabi still loves a cuddle and a kiss, and he enjoys being held when it isn't play time. His preferred sleeping spot at night is right next to you with his favourite blanket, which call his nest. This blanket will be going with him to his new home. 
Located in Langwarrin.

I love to play and bash up my siblings, chase a mouse toy, pounce on a dangler and just be a crazy, loveable kitten. I have a witching hour each day where I love to do zoomies around my foster mums house, so be prepared!
I have a really big purr and once you find the right smooching spot, I will flop over on my side for a belly rub.
I will need to be adopted with either one of my siblings, or my furever family needs to have a young friendly cat, who will want to play with me and help me get into mischief. 
I am good with small dogs and don't mind young kids either...making me the purrfect family cat. 
I will be ready to join my new family from the 21st of January, as I am not getting desexed until the 18th.

Unfortunately Geisha has been diagnosed with HCM and is currently on medication that she will need for the rest of her life. Regular appointments with a certified cardiologist will also be required, at her most recent appointment with Dr Richard Woolley we were told that she is doing well and the disease has not progressed any further. Her next scan will be due in November 2022. So far she is responding really well to her medication, but as with all cases of HCM there are no guarantees and her new owners would need to be understanding of this. We are looking for someone to provide her an attentive, loving home and spoil her for the rest of her life, no matter how long it may be - we understand this may not be for everyone, HCM is a heartbreaking disease, but we trust that there is a wonderful new family out there that will be able to support her through it.
Geisha is curious by nature and may be okay with another pet if they had a proper, slow introduction - but she is a princess and would love being a spoilt only pet even more! Someone who is home a lot would be perfect as she loves company. She would not suit a home with children as they make her anxious.
We are not in a rush to rehome her, our focus is on finding the perfect place for her to be comfortable and cared for with someone who understands her needs.

292,292,Lottie (Special Needs),Looking for love,"Lottie is a sweet and affectionate 7 month old Domestic Medium Hair girl. She loves to snuggle with her foster parents and will often sleep at the end of the bed . She is still a kitten and enjoys playing with toys  when her humans are busy. Lottie can be spooked by loud noises or sudden movements and will take herself back to her safe spaces, usually in her scratcher. This cheeky little girl will find the smallest of spaces to curl up in even if its in the wardrobe or on top of your desk.
Lottie LOVES other cats  and must have at least one, friendly feline companion in her new home who will be her friend. She currently alternates between stalking her foster siblings and finding places to sleep next to them. Lottie uses other cats as a guide and often learns how to navigate things by watching them. She has been in foster care with dogs  and enjoys their company too! 
Lottie has been diagnosed with Cerebellar Hyperplasia which means that her cerebellum did not fully develop in the womb. This part of the brain  is in charge of fine motor skills so she 'wobbles' and sometimes has trouble moving around a space or will fall over or off something. Her condition will not worsen but it will not improve. Luckily for Lottie, her CH is mild and she has no trouble moving around the house. She is able to get onto beds and couches, and use the litter tray. She manages really well on tiles and floorboards (with the occasional drift) so there can be any type of flooring in her new home. She is very clever and will work out how to get places that she cannot simply jump onto by using other things as 'steps'.
Although she is able to navigate the house easily there are things that make Lottie's life a lot easier. She eats out of a raised bowl because her head tremors increase when she in concentrating or puts her her down, this means that she now has no trouble eating different types of foods. We have given her a low sided litter tray so that she is easily able to access it which has worked very well but she does prefer a clean tray. We also give Lottie access to a ramp to get onto the couch which she uses really well. As she grows this may not be needed as she is already able to jump onto the couch without assistance. Nevertheless would like for her to continue to have access to these accommodations in her forever home so that she is able to live full and happy life.
Lottie's ideal home would be with a single person, couple or a family with older, respectful teenagers who can treat her with the respect she deserves. For obvious reasons Lottie is looking for a single-storey, indoor only home  so that she is able to actively explore on her own. Although she cannot jump very far she can still climb and has sneakily used a dog door in her previous foster home, so if there was one in her new home she should not have access to it. As far as CH cats go Lottie is one of the lucky ones and can live an independent life. However, if possible, we would love to find a home with previous CH experience or one who has done their research about the condition and understand what is best for her.
She is such a loving little lady who makes us laugh on a daily basis. Her new home will be lucky to have her quirkiness and antics to keep them entertained. 
She is in care in Narre Warren South and is available for adoption in Melbourne and the surrounding suburbs.

Both Celeste & Alula will require daily brush and regular maintenance of their beautiful long coats - Brushing and the occasional trip to the groomers is essential.

Nala can be a little shy and cautious at first, but once she gets to know you, she will come and sit next to you for pats and loves to give you kisses on your nose. She can be picked up but doesn't love being carried around. 
She doesn't mind other cats, but she isn't anyone's best friend and will hiss at kittens if they are being too silly so we think a home with another quiet cat or alone would be best for her.

* * * * * * * * * * * * * *
AMELIA (4yrs) is a quiet lady, until it is time to eat.  Then she'll let you know what time it is :)
Amelia came into care with her 3 kittens after living in an industrial estate.
She has come a long way in care, from hissy protective Mumma, to now accepting pats (on her terms of course).  She does prefer all four paws on the floor, and probably won't seek out cuddles, however she will roll around the floor and chase balls or dust bunnies down the hallway.
Given her earlier life being spent in the great outdoors, Amelia deserves to live a life of indoor luxury, however she would love a little outdoor time, provided it is in the safety of an outdoor enclosure only.
KATSUMI (3yrs) is an adorable girl.
Katsumi is quite shy, who will need an extremely patient guardian to allow her time to settle in her new home.
Her curious nature gets her exploring the home when it is quiet, and she can be vocal when it comes to mealtime.  She loves chasing balls down the hallway. 
Due to her beautiful light features, Katsumi will require an indoor-only lifestyle to protect her from the harsh Australian sun.
Katsumi is an all paws on the ground kinda girl but is slowly learning the joy of a pat and her carer is able to hold her for short stints. 
These ladies would be best suited to a quiet home without children (max. 2 adult humans).  They would also suit someone who will allow them time to settle into their new environment without expectations, given their very shy nature.
Amelia and Katsumi are located in Greenvale (near Melbourne Airport).

Delilah is one of the sweetest smooches weve ever met! She loves sitting on top of the couch with her carers and snuggling up on the bed. She has an adorable little squeak meow but a loud purr, particularly while shes getting pats. As she is still quite young, Delilah adores playtime and playing soccer with toys around the house. 
She gets along well with all the other animals in the house, from the adult cats to the tiny kittens but her best friend is the boisterous little dog! She loves to gently bat to play with the dog, and cuddles up with her and starts to groom. Delilah would adore a home where she could have a friend with her more often than not, whether this was human or animal. 
Delilah has had a lot of her soft medium length coat shaved off. When she was dropped at an emergency animal hospital, she was covered in matting, dirt and injuries. She has healed up wonderfully and her fur is growing back quickly. Were so happy her rough start hasnt dampened her sweet nature in the slightest. 
Delilah will bond strongly with her humans and give them plenty of love, but she is shy with visitors. She would suit a quieter home and would be fine with older children (10+).",Female,Domestic Medium Hair Cat,Forever Friends Animal Rescue,"Thomastown, VIC",Medium,"09 Jan, 2022",250.00,8.0,

Because of my pretty white fur, I need to find a home where I am inside only. That sun will be mean to my skin otherwise. I have a few scabs on my ears which will need to be monitored. 
As I will be an indoor-only kitty, I'd like lots of indoor space to explore.
The vet person also found some yucky teeth when they desexed me, so took most of them out (they left the lucky 2). I feel so much better now that they are gone, and I am still clever enough to eat both wet and dry food. My gums are all healed and will not need any special care moving forward.
Do you think that you could be my furever family?

309,309,Hope,Loves company,"HOPE IS LOOKING FOR A FOREVER HOME
Read full profile before applying please.
Hope is a 3yr old + lady with lovely black and white markings. She is an interesting & unique cat  she can be a bit hot and cold, as she likes being around people, but isn't sure if she wants to rub against you, give you little love bites or wants a bit of a pat? She's an indecisive and peculiar lady 
This being said, she is quite friendly and wants to be around her humans  She is comfortable around dogs, but can be a bit picky with her cat friends so would be better suited as the only cat in the family.
Hope is very happy outside in her kitty run enclosure, but does like to come inside and socialise as well. Hope requires a house with a cat enclosure as she really likes her outside time in the sun and playing outdoors. 
She needs time to warm up to people, so we are looking for someone special who can understand this girls needs.
 Hope needs a forever home:
 Solo cat in household
 She needs a home without children.
 Hope needs a home with an outdoor cat enclosure
 A family who is patient & understanding of her quirks.
You will be rewarded with a lot of love from Hope, she has come a long way from the timid & scared girl that she once was.
Please enquire if this sounds like your kind of forever friend, a cat that doesn't ask for much but a quiet and patient loving home, good food, company and a warm safe place to spend their days. Could this be you?

310,310,Billy & Marche,Bonded brothers,"Billy (white and ginger short hair) and Marchie (ginger long hair) are sweet and gentle 9-year-old closely bonded brothers who will make wonderful additions to your family. They are a constant source of entertainment and despite their age, they love to play with each other which usually involves playful wrestling or mutual grooming, and they will often sleep snuggled up in the same box. They are very well behaved and are both skilled users of the litter box.
Billy is more sensitive but also more inquisitive and cheeky, and has a bigger personality. He loves human affection and will flop down in front of you for tummy tickles. He likes to run around the house, chasing his tail and starting play fights with Marchie. Although he is otherwise affectionate, he doesnt like to be picked up and he can be easily startled.
Marchie is a very handsome, large, and floppy cat, with extremely soft fur. He is more chilled than Billy and is happy to be picked up and cuddled, and likes to spend all day curled up in a warm spot. He is very affectionate and has an unusual fascination with licking people, particularly their hair and/or beard!
** Billy came to FFAR with a diagnosed grade 5 heart murmur. Currently Billy does not require any medication or special treatment, and during the time he has spent with his foster carer, no issues relating to the heart murmur have been noted and it does not appear to affect him. Close monitoring of his condition is required, with the potential need for intervention and/or medication in the future.

311,311,Arya & Bron,Mother & Daughter,"  Please ensure you read this profile in full and understand Arya and Bron's personality and needs. 
ARYA and BRON are mother and daughter, who are seeking a forever home together.
Both Arya and Bron love interactive play with humans and can equally entertain themselves.  They both love to go on 'paw patrols' around the home, investigating every nook and cranny.  But you'll never loose them.  You'll either here them chatting away while exploring or chirping at the birds through the window.
Arya and Bron are often found snuggling and/or grooming each other.
The ladies would require a quiet indoor-only lifestyle with a single person or couple (no children or other pets please), where they can build their confidence and show off their beautiful personalities to you. They will require extreme patience for them to settle in their new home.
** ARYA (Mum - 5yrs) **
Arya, AKA Mumma, has a personality that will shine once she's comfortable.  Shed love some toys to play with (the fishing rod is her favourite) and a human who doesnt mind a bit of rough and tumble type of play.
Arya will look forward to your return home and will greet you tell you about her day, and ask you about yours.
Arya loves legs to rub against and a bit of a pat. However once she gets to know you, you may be rewarded with a cuddle. 
Her luscious medium length locks need a quick regular brush and her nails a trim.
** BRON (Daughter - 4yrs) **
Theres more to Bron than just that cute-as-a-button face! 
Shes not a lap-sitter, preferring all four paws to be on the ground, at least until you get to know each other better.  She can be picky about her humans and prefers to give out love to only a select few.
Bron's foster carer has nicknamed her Flopsy because she likes to flop over her carer's shoulder for a brief cuddle. But dont let all that fool you - Bron isnt needy, shes an independent lady. She happily entertains herself with her toys, or takes a midday nap while youre at work or away from home for the day.
Arya and Bron have a very special place in their foster carer's heart.  If you think you're a purrfect match for Arya and Bron, then please drop us a line.

312,312,Lyon,Ladies' man,"  Thank you for your interest in Lyon. Please read Lyon's profile thoroughly before making an enquiry, to ensure you understand his personality and needs. 
 Are you a quiet, loving and very patient female homebody?
 Lyon loves da ladies. Not da men. Or da children. If you live with males or children, or if they visit regularly, Lyon is not da cat for you! 
 Lyon would also love a home that allows for lots of exploring and different vantage points, therefore he would like a good sized house that you are settled in for the long-term (rather than an apartment or unit).
 He also loves the great outdoors and will love a large safe and secure enclosure where he can enjoy sunbathing and birdwatching.  Once he is well and truly settled, he would then love the opportunity to explore your backyard.  A home that can offer Lyon an indoor/outdoor lifestyle is a must.  (NOTE: a fenced backyard is not a secure enclosure.)
 Lyon would love a friendly feline companion.  However, a home without a dog would be best.
 Lyon is a disciplined dude and likes to go to bed at 10pm and wake up early. You will not need an alarm clock.
A former street cat, Lyon has shown his foster carer how incredibly grateful he is to have been rescued and lets her know this every single day.
Lyon is incredibly loving and loyal to those who are patient and dedicated to working with him to build his confidence with humans.  Lyon is very shy with strangers (a guys gotta keep himself safe!) and will take a lot longer to trust new people.  However, if you are prepared to give Lyon the time, love and gentle encouragement you will be rewarded by being on the receiving end of an extremely loving cat.  In time he will shower you with love, enjoy a never-ending supply of kisses, knead you, make air biscuits, greet you with his lion cub sounds and will want to be your warm, fur-powered blanket in winter.  He will soothe you to sleep with his turbo-powered purr, and make you laugh with his chattiness, saying the cutest things.
Lyon still prefers to have all four paws on the ground, but once you have his trust you can start working on short stints in picking him up.
Lyon is very intelligent and needs stimulated play, whether this is with you or entertaining himself.  He will lie on his back with his paws in the air, just itching to catch whatever fluffy prey you are dangling over him - check out the video.   He is so intelligent, in fact, that he might well like to do some clicker training with you. And would love the mental stimulation of daily 15-minute play sessions.   He would also much prefer his human to be around more often than not.
Are you the forever human Lyon has been waiting for?

She is a very sweet girl who seeks out affection and pats. She happily sits by her foster carer while she works and has showed immense patience and care with her little ones. Shes quite vocal when she greets you or when she thinks its time for her next meal. 
Molly does not like dogs, although much of this is likely to be her protecting her kittens. She is settling into living with other feline friends. She is fine with kids and isn't fussed by their energy/ noise.

Very sleek and sophisticated, but she can rough house just as madly as her foster siblings, infant she often teaches them a thing or two! 
Very inquisitive and full of fun.
Loves people and lots of cuddles, but will wander off to find a sunny windowsill or protected purchase in the outside Catnip enclosure to get a bit of sunbathing in. 
Very athletic and excellent at catching flies and moths, so don't be surprised if you are presented with a gift for your devotion to her. 
Would suit a single person or family with kids 8yo+.
Olivia would be happy as a single cat or in a multi-cat household.

They have been with me for a week and already in that time Im able to pat them, Louise enjoys this and will actually purr a little now. Thelma will cower but once you are patting her she will actually enjoy it. Separating them will probably help them as they will then rely on their people rather than each other.
Indoor home with a cat run would be amazing but they will need to be confined until settled enough perhaps in a crate or a room.

He is very smart and listens to you closely: when we first started playing, he was rough though now I say ""gently, not so hard"" and he looks in my eyes to see if everything is ok. I've never had to say ""no"" or discipline him because he listens to tone and wants to please you. Older mature children will adore him; small children's joy may provoke scratches and bites from loud noises and unpredictable movements.
Eddie is very vocal with a tiny quiet meow that means everything and anything: he's hungry, he wants to play, wants love and attention, and wants the pats you're giving to another kitty. 
Eddie always wants to play and gets on well with other kitties, after the usual kitty negotiations about house roles.

Eli likes to sit back and stay in the home base while Murphy explores. They are both very playful and love to engage in play with humans or with each other. As best friends, they happily entertain themselves for hours just by playing hide and seek, or wrestling like young boys do. 
Eli and Murphy are looking for a loving home that will support their affectionate yet playful personalities by engaging with them in play and continuing to show them how wonderful it is to have human pats and cuddles.

He is incredibly affectionate and will be your little shadow - following you from room to room so he can be right beside you. 
Belgrave LOVES his pats and cuddles and is very demanding of them. He doesnt care if youre on a zoom-meeting - he needs his pats! 
As sweet as he is, Belgrave also considers himself the boss of the household and can occasionally be a little bit of a jerk about it. He doesnt like being told what to do and will make this pretty clear to you.
Being rushed, blocked by arms or trapped in small spaces are Belgrave's hard boundaries and hell let you know. Because of this, Belgrave would do best in a large home or one with an enclosed outdoor area. He considers children merely beneath him and so will need a home with adults only, where he can remain the centre of attention. 
We're looking for a specific type of adopter who is willing to work with us to help Belgrave find a better outlet for his anxieties. He'll need lots of play and love!
Despite his jerk tendencies, Belgrave is an incredibly fun cat to have around who really just wants to be loved and spoiled. Just dont get on his bad side...

But I looove pats and am always on the prowl for any opportunity to play with my foster carers. (My favourite toy to play with is a ping pong ball!!). I also have adorable, fluffy fur which makes me extra fun to cuddle. Something unique about my brother and I is that we have super cute meows, which can sometimes come out a bit squeaky!

Just like my brother I also love to play and will chase most things that move. Now that Ive learnt how good pats are though my favourite time of the day is the morning when my foster carer wakes up, because she always gives me lots of pats to make up for the time shes been asleep.

https://www.victoriandogrescue.org.au/about-vicdrg/adoption-and-foster-application-forms.html
Victorian Dog Rescue has a six-week full refund policy and a lifetime takeback guarantee that includes 50 per cent of the adoption fee refunded.
Russell came to us in very poor condition, with a previously damaged tail, skinny, sad and with eyes that had almost given up hope.  He had obviously been homeless for a while, abandoned perhaps by a previous person as sadly seems to happen so often.
He cannot believe that he now has a name and a place to stay, food, and company.   In return he is the most affectionate cat you would ever meet. He does not ask for much but will come up to you for strokes and butt his head against you to get it. If you ignore him he quietly walks away and sits himself at a distance so he can keep an eye on you. If there was cat who could read a room, Russell is that boy.
He is happiest on a full stomach, curled up snoozing the day away. Russell does not jump higher than a bed, couch or a chair to sit on.
While he enjoys watching the world go by, he  does not try to escape like younger cats may do. He likes to be around people as much as he can but is okay on his own, snoozing away, as long as there is food and water around. When hungry Russell gets very vocal and will tell you tales of starvation woes. He follows you around when he's not snoozing or watching, but he is not intrusive when he senses you need some space.
Russell deserves to spend the rest of his life in a home with love and company. Perhaps you can give him that.

He will smooch you (with vigour), he will love you, he will run around like a lunatic being chased by an invisible devil and leave you in fits of laughter, he will play nicely with other creatures of various sizes - including ratties.... however, he will also lie down like a furry slug in the middle of everything and some of the strangest places (this has, in the past, included a litter tray that I then filled with litter and someone came to use without him bothering to move!) and sometimes get a fright from his own shadow (mostly a figure of speech... but not always).
Lying down next to the food bowl when dinner gets served? No need to get up!
Oh hey there, good to see you, let me twitch my feather duster tail at you like a peacock impressing its lady friend! 
Hug me! I want to hug you! Oh, I must smooch your face like the world is going to end any moment!
Toothless is precious. We love Toothless. We want to see this sweet boy find his way into a furever family that will love him too, and accommodate his slightly neurotic nature. We would like that family to include other fur-siblings, preferably at least one other kitty. Kids would be okay, so long as they are respectful and not excessively boisterous, due to his sensitive nature.
It is imperative that Toothless be kept indoors or safely confined to his home property with a fully secure enclosure if he is given access outdoors. His personality puts him at significant risk if he were to stray from his home yard, not to mention, he's just a bit of a derp and we worry he wouldn't understand danger if it hit him in the face.
Don't have another kitty buddy at home? Willing to consider adopting a pair? Although Toothless arrived into our care with a sibling who sadly passed away, we have other cats and kittens available for adoption who he has grown up with and currently happily resides with.

Please be patient waiting for a reply though, as our foster mummy is working solo and also operating a very busy business in addition to caring for all of us and trying to find us the bestest homes. xx

359,359,Bowser & Peach,Looking for love,"Bowser is an independent boy who was born on the street with his family. He was the most cautious of his siblings, but his personality has blossomed in our care he has become braver and loves to sleep on the bed and play. 
Hes independent by nature and likes cuddling on his terms
Hes no longer a scaredy-boy and is ready for his dream home. 
He would love to be adopted with his sister Peach, they share a very special bond and we would feel too guilty separating them after all theyve been through

360,360,Abel,"Sweet, Smoochy Wobbly Boy","Meet Abel.
This handsome, sweet boy may look a bit grumpy, but he can't help it! He's actually an incredibly sweet, gentle and loving soul who has had a bit of a rough start before landing on his feet (something he's not too good at!) when he found himself in rescue.
This boy is an absolute SMOOCH. He LOVES faces and will happily smooch you all day if you let him! In fact, he may smooch you regardless.
Abel is estimated to be about 4 years old, and arrived into our care with flu and a bad eye infection that had caused entropion. After having surgery to correct his entropion (a painful condition where the eye lids roll inwards and the fur/lashes rub constantly on the surface of the eye), and as his confidence improved, it became apparent there was more to his condition, so we went to see a neurologist.
Indications are that the infection that caused his entropion has also effected his cerebellum - the part of the brain responsible for our movement and balance. This means that Abel is wobbly on his feet and the dear lad always looks a bit drunk! A very happy drunk, however!
This purr-y boy (who sounds a bit like a cricket sometimes, when he really gets going!) isn't in the least bit phased by his bumbliness, although he will need a few minor accommodations to reduce the risk of him having a tumble, and one does need to put him down very slowly, and let him get his feet under himself first.
Abel is great with other cats, and although a little shy around children initially, once he feels comfortable, he is fine with them too, as long as they are respectful. He is playful, although his wobbliness does make it hard for him to keep up with more boisterous youngsters when they run around like mad things. 
Abel will need to be strictly indoors only, or with access to a suitable fully secure and enclosed outdoor area for his safety. This is non-negotiable. He will also need someone willing to brush him routinely to maintain his coat, and occasionally administer eye drops. His wobbliness means he isn't able to groom himself as well as normal, so a regular brush will keep his coat healthy, help prevent hairballs (ewww!) and reduce excess shedding.
Stress can result in his eyes getting a bit of discharge or redness, which is manageable with eye drops (these can be purchased at the chemist and we will advise you on the correct ones to use). If stress is minimised, then these are rarely needed. A high quality diet and appropriate home environment are key factors in this regard.

I'm a super cute little 14-month-old dude who just LOVES his peoples! Will you be my peoples? Can I cuddle you and snuggle you, give you kisses and hang out on your shoulders?!
I am great with other cats, and really enjoy their company, so I need a home with other kitties, or you could adopt me with my foster-best-buddy, Tom, who is a real character too! 
I am really lucky, as I came into care with my brothers as a tiny, malnourished orphan, but with lots of love and a surrogate mummy-cat who nursed us, we made an amazing turn around and have grown into healthy boys!! I do have a very, very mild case of Cerebellar Hypoplasia.  This isn't a cause for concern though. It just means that my coordination and some of my physical awareness isn't *quite* as good as other kitties, and my foster mumma says it makes me a little bit... distracted and slower to learn than others. Like, when I'm really focused on something, I don't notice other things around me. But if it wasn't for my a couple of my brothers also having the condition a bit more severely than me, you wouldn't even know!
I really love to sleep with my peoples, so I really need peoples who will let me sleep in their room with them at least some of the time. But my foster mumma says it wouldn't be a good idea to let me near hooman babies or toddlers, because I can be a bit too smoochy and sometimes try to lie on her face to be close to her, so please keep this in mind if you have, or plan to have, skin-kittens.
So do you want to be my peoples??
You know what would be really super-dooper awesome!? If you were Tom's (https://www.petrescue.com.au/listings/886603) peoples too! He's my buddy, did I tell you? He's a really cool dude. He's like... my brother from another mother! We like to hang out and play together, and cuddle. And we're super cute. He's the tabby in the pictures with me. We're the same age, and both looking for our peoples. Foster-mumma says he's more like a dog than a cat. Dogs are cool people too though!

373,373,Gabby & Isabella ^^Dandy Cat Rescue^^,Bonded sister kittens," $500 for the pair 
Gabby and Isabella are like peas in a pod  and they are never very far away from one another at all times. So we are looking for a home for these two girls where they can stay together forever.
Born in a litter of three kittens, Gabby and Isabella became inseparable right from the start. Their life-long bond has only deepened with age, so having one be without the other would be unthinkable. 
Like most great partnerships, these girls have different personalities that complement the others. While both girls enjoy a quiet life, Gabby tends to rely on Isabella to show her the way and give her confidence with new things. 
Gabby, being a little more reserved, will come and wrap herself around your feet when youre working from home or will pop up next to you on the sofa and the bed. As time goes on we expect she will show her affectionate side more and more. 
Isabella is the one who will search for you if she cant see you. Izzy is a very friendly and quirky kitten who loves to run off with treasures (tissues being a favourite) and she is the first to explore new things, climb and seek out new experiences. 
Both girls share funny croaky little meows and they both have a love of the same toy  little mice toys. They will play with the mice toys for hours and it is hilarious to watch.
This pair would do really well in a quieter home where they will be the only pets. Small children tend to frighten them so young ones aged 12 and over are recommened. These girls would also be great in a home of only adults or a single person wanting some terrific company.
Gabby and Isabella do not react well to dogs so we do not recommend a home with a dog/s. Both girls get along with their foster carers cat so they would be fine if you have a kitty and are looking to expand your fur family.

Have you always wanted a labrador, but you're allergic to dogs?! Well.... I'm the solution to your problem!
I'm a very special and unique 14 month old boy. I'm very affectionate and playful, love snuggling, but I also love people and other animals, and am happy to wear a harness and am learning to use a lead. I don't mind car rides and am getting more confident with unfamiliar and new places, especially if I have someone I trust with me.
I am a bit of a garbage disposal, though, so you can't leave food out unattended when I'm around, or I'll hoover it up lickety-split!
Did I mention that I love cuddles? I really love wrapping my arms around my human's neck and being held. I also just like to generally hang out with my people and be part of whatever is... or isn't.... going on.
I'm looking for my own family with other fur-siblings - or maybe you could adopt me with my foster best-buddy, Gremlin? He's a pretty cool dude too. He and his brother are from a litter that nearly didn't survive and they have a condition called Cerebellar Hypoplasia, but luckily for Gremlin, it's really, really mild and doesn't effect him much. This condition just means that he's a little bit less coordinated than normal. Our foster mummy jokes that he is part-parrot. Do you like birds? Gremlin loves to be held, cuddled and ride around on your shoulders if he can - good thing he's not as long as I am! He's the other handsome boy, the light ginger floof, in the photo of me with other kitties. We like to play and cuddle together. It would be awesome if we could have the same family.
For our safety, we should be kept indoors or with access to an enclosed outdoor area. Other outdoor trips under supervision, with a harness and lead, would be okay, so long as we're comfortable and it's a safe place (away from vehicles and traffic that could hurt us or cause us to panic and run). I would make a great therapy cat, although Gremlin might need to stay home for those occasions, if he lives with me too, as he is a bit too enthusiastic about being on peoples' shoulders!

I might be nearly 14 years old, but I feel three years old inside. In fact, I would say most wouldnt be able to guess my age at all! After all, age is but a number, right? And its rude to count! As far as Im concerned, I am a beautiful young kitty, full of energy and attitude, and definitely young at heart! Watch me play, Ill give those young whipper-snappers a run for their money!
My favourite game is to chase a ribbon on a long handled teasing stick. I win all the time and the ribbon is now in shreds! My only problem is a sore spine on my back near my tail....x-rays have shown a rather out of shape area...there was an accident a long time ago and it has come back to haunt me a little. I am on pain medication as it can get quite sore for me  I take the drops with my food. Some may say Im a bit of a fussy eater, but I say I just have very good taste! My plate of choice is tuna with whitebait, which helps to camouflage the taste of the medicine, taken once per day. 
When you get to my age, you can guarantee an interesting and colourful life. Once I spent three months spent up a tree - the vantage points from up there are something else! I love people almost as much as I love sleeping.
Im a faithful old girl with lots of love to give to someone who can be there for me in my senior years. Will you be there for me when it counts? Make an enquiry about me today!

But I am quite independent as well and can entertain myself with toys if you are busy. I LOVE playing with my TOYS and chasing them.
My foster mum calls me a lil bunny as I love to run and do sudden bunny-flops when being patted. I love sitting next to her when she is watching TV.
She loves that I come running to her when she calls my name (which can be Poppy, Popeye, Papaya, Poppa)..she loves me to bits. 
I am currently living with a couple of adult cats in my foster home, but I dont play with them as much, and hence, would love being the sole furry member of my new home.
I can be a little shy around loud noises and new people and I might hide under a couch for a short while but I will come back to my hoomans to show my love.
I am very curious, and adore watching the world go by out the window and I love to inspect every part of the house.I also LOVE carboard boxes so I hope you will keep them coming, haha!
Check out the my videos of watching the rain out the window and hanging out with my foster hooman on the couch.

I'm a super confident, affectionate boy who will take no time to settle into my forever home.

I'm rather handsome, even if I do say so myself, have you seen my markings!  I think they're pretty unique,  if you look closely you may even be able to make out the shape of a heart!  It's rather fitting I have a heart shape over my tummy as I do love my food.
I am inquisitive and love to explore my surroundings,  I'll chirp & chat away while doing so.  I love to gaze out the window, watching the birdies but as much as I'd like to go and play with them, as I'm light in colour, I'm best kept indoors.
I like the company of other kitties, but probably no young children, I can sometimes get a little excited at playtime.
Thank you so much for taking the time to read my profile.  I can't wait to meet you and move to my forever home!

392,392,Jester and Billy - Located in Gowanbrae,Sweet bonded pair,"Are you looking for two pretty best friends? Youre in luck! Jester and Billy are bonded buds who do so well together, teaching each other how to cat after a rough start to life. They groom one another, cuddle, play fight and sleep curled like a yin and yang. 
Hi, Im Jester, and Im a sweet little boy who is looking for head pats and a comfy place to lounge. After being rescued - my new life was a bit of an adjustment, but luxury and endless food is what a medieval entertainer like myself truly deserves. I am sure to make you smile, maybe even laugh at my funny ways of showing my love and affection. It may take a little while for me to warm up, I am shy and reserved around new people but hanging out in a space we can share is a surefire way to receive headbutts and meows. Once Im comfortable - Ill make my presence known by having conversations with you. I also like to snore as I snooze.
Jester is FIV+ and requires a home that understands how to support him for a long, happy life - this may include teeth cleanings and regular vet checks. I would like multiple people around since I love attention - therefore a family with young adults would be great. Jester also must be strictly indoors unless a catio/cat enclosure is provided due to his existing condition (which doesnt limit him at all!!) I love to play and be brushed, then sleep as a loaf for the night.
Hi, Im Billy, and Im a sweet, shy little boy looking for a family to help me open up. Im a small, younger boy but its time for me to settle down in a forever home with lots of toys and comfy places to lounge. I enjoy talking and doing zoomies around the room, and then when Im settled, the purring motor turns on. I love to move my blankets around to get comfy, and if that means dragging it over my food bowl, so be it. I dont enjoy being in my carrier and it does make me quite scared, but over time and maybe with my bestie by my side, the big wide world will seem less scary. 
Together, Jester and Billy will bring you endless amounts of love, and they would love to be around a family that gives them space when its needed (so observe their cuteness from afar). When its time for pats and playing, they will let you know. Do you have a place for us in your hearts and home?

393,393,Magic - Located in Bulleen,Super smooch,"Hello my name is Magic! 
Im hoping you may be my fur-ever home and Im here to tell you a few things about me. 
I am a lovely, smoochy girl who loves pats and attention. If you let me, Ill even groom your hands. 
Most of the day I like to find a little hidden spot to snooze all day, fear not! I dont do this to hide from you because if you find me hiding Ill usually come out chirping away and happily receive pats before returning back to my spot. 
I would suit a home that was quiet and with no young children as I can become overwhelmed by loud noises or strangers.  Of an evening I like to be near you, sitting on the couch with you or plonking myself at your feet. I also like watching TV, nature documentaries are my favourite (especially the wild cats). 
I looooove my food and this means that Im a little overweight and on a special diet at the moment. Sometimes I might ask for food but I should only be fed twice a day. So I will need someone who is strong enough to say no and help me on my weight loss journey. 
Im a purr machine and just genuinely like being around people and their company. 
I also like to play, strings and pom-poms are my favourite. 
I have a lot of love to give and hoping to find someone who will love me with all my quirks.

If at the end of this discussion you would like to progress we will then arrange an online meet n greet with the carer and cat. 
If you think this cat might be your PURRFECT match we will be utilising our premises at Neko HQ in Preston for the final meet n greet and if agreed adoption.
Our carers are unable to have a guest in their homes. 
We ask that only one person from the family attend, and that all COVID safe practices are followed to ensure your health and that of our volunteers as well as the general community. 
We thank you for your patience throughout this process.

394,394,Lance and Melanie - Located in Northcote,Bonded best friends,"Available to meet by video chat
Melanie and Lance are a sweet, bonded pair who have been together their whole lives. They sleep together, wash each other, and play together and cannot be separated so must be adopted as a pair. They are both very good cats. 
Lance has cardiomyopathy which means his heart isn't as effective as it could be, which means he is less active than other cats his age and acts more like a senior cat, and it's hard to predict how long his life will be, although he is currently living his best life. Lance will try to drink your coffee and quietly creeps onto the bed in the morning to wait for you to wake up. Melanie is less subtle and will come up for a pat and stick her butt in your face. 
Both cats are a little on the shy side with new people, although warm up once they know you. Lance likes to loaf on the couch and Melanie prefers to sit on cat towers and watch birds outside. They're very good at sleeping through the night and using the litter box. Both are obsessed with Da Bird feather toy and playing in their tunnel and also love eating kangaroo. 
They are suspicious of dogs and children and think they are a bit dumb. They took a few weeks to warm up to a new foster cat who wanted to be their friend but now allow their foster sister to join their cuddle puddle and play with her. She's not yet up for adoption as she is timid but could be paired with Melanie and Lance for anyone looking for a trio.

395,395,Wilfred - Located in Carlton,Playful and love pats,"Wilfred- playful and love pats! 
Wilfred is an amazing cat! 
When he first came he was very scared. But with time he became the most affectionate and loving cat. He loves pats and he will reward you with a lots of kisses (liking your hand) while you you pat him. He  never gets tired of being petted and he will purr every time you pat him. 
Is very easy to fall in love with Wilfred and get attached to him, as he likes to be close to you. Also, he will always receives you when you arrive home.
Apart from the affection he loves to receive and give, he also loves to play! He can spend the entire day playing with a ball or chasing a laser. It is really cute to see him running around chasing the ball and sometimes with the ball on his mouth. 
As majority of cats, Wilfred is very clean. He will never make a mess with his litter and always covers very well. 
Wilfred is a lovely company and will always shows you he is grateful for the care. 
He loves looking through the window and gets excited when the birds are singing outside. 
Even though Wilfred is not scared of humans anymore, he is still a bit nervous with loud noises and therefore I think he needs a house without kids. Also, the person who adopts him, needs to understand him and be patient with him the first few days at his new house, as he will probably take some time to be playful and outgoing as he is. 
Wilfred is a wonderful, amazing, and loving cat.

I'll need a couple of weeks to settle into your home before I feel like it's mine but once I do I'm a bit of a nut in the best possible way. I like to talk and chatter to you and I'm very much into human interaction. I'm smart and will take you to my room for my food because and I like routine if you give me my own safe space I'm happy to chill in there if things get busy in the household. 
I like to explore and have a play and off-load some energy as I'm still young even if also spend many hours lazing about. 
Ideal date includes amazing you with my agility and catching of red laser dots, I do love a bit of a play. Afterwards we can cuddle and let the soft sound of my purrs soothe us both. I tend to worry about strange/loud/unexpected things, so lets keep it all real relaxed and let the good times roll. 
Best suited to adult household and or with older mature children who respect my need to not be smothered. It's true I'm a huge smoocher but I need time together to know you first before I let you tickle me just anywhere!

Give her a view of the outside world, some warm and sunny spots to relax and this girl is set! As mentioned, Bella is quite independent and she will come to you for a pat when she wants, not the other way around!

399,399,Hazelnut - Located in Clifton Hill,Playful vocal girl,"HAZELNUT:
As Guns n Roses sang She's got eyes of the bluest skies and its said the benefits of hazelnuts include a boost to the health of your heartthis couldnt be more true for this beautiful girl.
Hazelnut came to us as a super timid girl who took a while to trust that humans can be kind, she has come a long way in the last month and shows us her true personality more and more each day.
Once she settled into her environment she loves to play, eats like a trooper and will come for the occasional head nudge and rub. She has started to show interest in sharing the sofa with people but on her own terms and for short burstsat the moment this princess is not a lap cat but anything is possible with time.
She will flourish in a patient environment where she has time to adjust to her new home and feel safe and protected. She is currently housed with another foster cat and while she tolerates her housemate, she would probably prefer to be an only child and definitely not into dogssorry pups!
Hazelnut is a Snowshoe breed which like Guns n Roses means she can be quite vocal at times but then who isnt!
Hazelnut has previously had all of her teeth removed due to dental disease. She has low level Inflammatory Bowel Disease. Currently her symptoms are very mild and the vets believe her occasional flare ups are caused by a build up of hair in her system, as her wet food diet does not help push the hair she consumes when grooming through her system the way a high fibre dry food does. Flare ups can include occasional vomiting or soft stool.
 To help her sensitive digestion and reduce her symptoms, she has to be given a micro dose of anti-inflammatory/antibiotic medicine every morning and will require a sensitive soft food diet. She is also on probiotics long term, these are easily mixed into her wet food.

401,401,Frankie and Teddy - Located in Glen Iris,Bonded brothers,"Frankie and Teddy love to play which includes running up and down the hallway with a little play wrestling with each other. They both love to sit on the window and look out at the birds. 
With the 6 weeks in foster care, they have already made huge progress from being very shy and hiding, to now sleeping in open spaces and asking for pats. Teddy is the more affectionate one who loves a pat and a back scratch whereas Frankie is slightly more reserved and only likes a pat if he is curled up and feels safe. 
Both cats very much comfort each other and will often sleep and snuggle together. They have so far lived indoors only and generally let off a lot of steam through play fighting during certain times of the day. 
They need to be adopted together as they have already bonded. Their adoptive family shouldn't rush into having affection too quickly as they will get scared (they will eventually come around but they also need a family who has patience). They do have a timid nature at times so would work best in a family with older children. They are both very food motivated so giving them treats will be the best way in gaining trust and getting them to explore new spaces.

During her twilight years, Doris isn't asking for much: just a safe and quiet place to call her own with someone who will allow her to enjoy retirement. She would love to be a companion for someone who would like company around the house.
Due to her older age, Doris does have some arthritis that is managed with joint supplements and pain relief as needed. Otherwise she's a healthy lady and ready to go home.

I used to live on the streets and didn't understand what safety and love from humans meant until my foster mum took me home from a cold and windy Melbourne night and changed my life.  After building the relationship with my foster mum for a few months, I love giving her plenty of rubs, sitting next to her and following her around the house. I might be quite shy in the beginning, but I just need some patience to know that I will be safe in your hands. I have so much love that I want to give my special human, and I am slowly learning to like other humans as well! 
I'm so young and the life I had on the streets was tough. My litter of kittens was rescued and adopted out.  To protect my babies was not easy out there but I made it and everyone who met my babies says that they're very very sweet. Because of the tough times I had to go through, I am now FIV positive. But please keep reading  my life will be just as long, healthy and happy as any cat, if you give me the proper care. This includes a nutritious diet, keeping me indoor only, and providing me with an enriching environment.  I love other cats and I'm getting along really well with my foster mum's cat who is FIV negative. We have been living together happily and harmoniously - I give her nudges and rubs all the time and she grooms me in return. It is very difficult for FIV to transmit between cats. I would love a home where there is a friendly resident cat that can keep me company and further assist me to trust humans.
I need a home where my human/s can be very patient with me as I am still a timid girl.
In my down time, I love sunbathing, taking my cat naps, and observe what you are up to! I may come across scared but very curious and sweet in nature. I really just want the world to know that I have so much love to give to a loving household. I will need lots of love, time, understanding and patience, to bring out the best in me.

440,440,Moneypenny Kidgerbury,Snuggle Bunny,"TO APPLY FOR ADOPTION PLEASE SEND IN APPLICATION FORM AVAILABLE BELOW:
https://www.victoriandogrescue.org.au/about-vicdrg/adoption-and-foster-application-forms.html
Victorian Dog Rescue has a six-week full refund policy and a lifetime takeback guarantee that includes 50 per cent of the adoption fee refunded.
Please note: Moneypenny is great with dogs and cats and will be rehomed with another friendly, young cat. She won't be suited to a home with children under 10/12 years.
And I quote:
""Angel face, you really are so special.""
""The most perfect mix of playful pounce and fluffy cuddles you'll ever meet.""
""Snuggle bunny delight.""
""Most adorable kitten I've ever seen.""
""My favourite little fluff ball.""
""Get down, don't climb that!"" (Oh no, wait. I think that's meant for my brothers, I'm an angel).
I don't like to brag too much, but these are just some of the wonderful things I've heard my foster mum say about me.
Hi, I'm Moneypenny and I'm a whole lot of love wrapped up in a gloriously fluffy coat. I love every thing and every one you could imagine. I love people and kittens and doggies and cuddles and toys and climbing and food and playing and booping and pouncing and napping.
I'm a social butterfly kind of girl and I love to do everything with a person or another furry friend, I'm not one to hang out on my own much. Something my new family needs to understand though is that it takes me time to be confident with new people; so when you come to meet me, I might run and hide but once I've settled into my new home you'll see how fun and sweet I really am.
I really enjoy being cuddled and played with at the same time. My foster mummy scoops me up and holds me on my back like a baby then dangles fingers or toys or ribbons for me to boop at. It is just my favourite thing of all time. Sure, I have to put up with about a thousand kisses but it's worth it.
You probably saw in my pictures that I have lovely long hair. When I'm older, I will need to be brushed, but I just love any kind of attention so I definitely won't mind hanging about for some grooming time.
I'm crossing my paws that my new home will have:
~ patient people who understand it takes time for me to make new friends.
~ people who adore me and spend lots of time playing with me and grooming me.
~ a lovely, friendly cat or kitten to play with when my fan club is busy doing other things.
~ lots of things to climb.
~ lots of yummy snacks.
~ indoor only or an outdoor enclosure with shade to protect my pink nose and ears and to keep me safe.

In her current house, Nala rarely ventures past the house perimeters. And she certainly wouldnt have to if she can stay at home and get belly rubs from her humans!
Nala has lived with a large dog and knows how to handle herself with curious dogs, usually by keeping to herself. But when it comes to cats, she would certainly prefer being the only feline friend in your house. 
Nala is pretty low maintenance and can be kept home alone. Nala knows and responds to her name so it might be the easiest for her new human to keep her wonderful name.

I wear my long, fluffy white and brown coat with pride, and I have gorgeous sea-green eyes (if I do say so myself!) I love being affectionate, although I can still be a bit timid at times. And when it comes to others of my own kind, well I absolutely love them....a male companion is 100% on my radar...and not negotiable, even if I am timid! You might find that I take a little time to come out of my shell, but I do promise you Ill make it worth the wait and effort. 
Do you have a small household of around three people max? I like a nice quiet house as I can get a bit frightened with lots of people around. I am partial to sunbaking on a dining chair or the couch and I love lots of pats or a good head bump. The idea of going to a home where there is a male cat  or where two of us get adopted together  would be wonderful for my confidence. How exciting would it be to have two cute pusses at home? If youre patient and kind, I promise I will trust you and love you back. Ive been a mum before, so I think maybe a male teenage kitten friend to nurture would be a wonderful thing! I have a lot of love and affection to give. I have been living with other cats and a small dog, who I dont mind too much at all  I guess I dont mind the little or old ones! Are you ready to adopt me? I feel as though we would be perfect for one another! Will you make an enquiry about me today?

He has such a bubbly, energetic, cuddly and gentle personality. He loves to cuddle and purr in his own time. He loves to play with his toys and keep himself entertained. Miso loves the company of people and always confident and friendly when he meets you.
Miso also loves his food and is always ready for his next feed. A good feed is a good way to this boy's heart. He has been fed at the same time as his two feline friends and sometimes goes for their food but most of the time sticks to his own food.
Miso is very confident and bubbly around people and always comes up for a stroke or a cuddle. He doesnt mind being picked up for a cuddle either. He can be a bit shy when he meets new people but then quickly grows into a confident little kitten. Miso loves to come and lay on you when he has any chance and will purr as loud as he can. He has so much love to give. 
Miso gets along really well with other cats but not very playful with them he would rather be playing with his toys. He would suit a home with a desexed kitty friend to show him what life as a cat is all about.
Miso hasnt had any recent experience with dogs.
He just loves being part of a family and would be fine with children. 
Miso is looking for an indoor only home to keep him safe from outdoor hazards such as traffic, dogs, foxes and others cats. He is litter trained. 
A home with a secure outdoor enclosure is something he may enjoy to get some fresh air but being a white coat, sun exposure should be avoided.

I love pats and cuddles and playing with my cat friends. Calm dogs are pretty cool too!
 Like many of my kitty friends, I am not a fan of being picked up. I would rather have all 4 paws on the ground. If your home has young children who may want to carry me around, I may not be the best match for you. I have settled in really well to my indoor lifestyle and I will be really pleased if this continues for me in my new home to keep me safe. I am very clean and always use the litter tray when I should.
My foster family say I am a good mix of playful and calm and am able to chill when my humans need me to spend time in my crate. 
I came into foster care from a large property with lots of other cats and I have a great connection with my feline companions. I do seek out their company and I will not be happy living on my own. A desexed kitty friend will be very important for me. Not only for the company I crave but also to help me settle into my new home. 
I am a sensitive boy who loves others. I take good care of any kittens that spend time in my foster house with me. Oh, yeah.

I went missing for a while, and when I was found unfortunately my previous family was unable to take me home so I am now seeking a new home to call my own.
I would do best in an adult home/home with teenage children as I can be a bit shy with loud noises and unpredictability. I also really dislike being put into my cat carrier and traveling so a stable home with minimal car trips would be best for me.
I am a social cat but I am best paired with a confident and relaxed personality, any cat who is a bit too full on can  make me want to hide away from them
I am a really lovely boy who deserves a second chance.

Meet our beautiful Nutmeg. 
Her story is quite sad, but not unusual. 
A lovely caring elderly lady had Nutmeg turn up on her doorstep one day, looking rather skinny and bedraggled. 
After trying to find her owners through door knocking and through her microchip details, no one came forward to claim Nutmeg so the sweet little old lady took her in until she could no longer care for herself or Nutmeg. 
This is when CARMAR were contacted by the sweet old ladies family to find Nutmeg another caring person/ family to love her for the final half of her 9 lives. 
Nutmeg is the cat that every cat lover wants! 
She's an absolute smoocher, she ONLY wants love and cuddles...that's what she craves. She truly is the most affectionate cat and only wants to love you.
Nutmeg is the perfect companion kitty cat. If you are looking for love and cuddles, Nutmeg is for you. 
She needs to be an only cat, she is not interested in being around any other foster kittens or cats. She is an only child cat. 
If you want tons of love and cuddles and affection, Nutmeg is for you.
She deserves a beautiful family who want to love her as much as she wants to be loved.
Nutmeg is desexed, micropped, flea and worm free and kitty litter perfect.

488,488,Tarzan,Affectionate Wild Child,"Based in Horsham Rural Victoria.
No we don't do deliveries, you need to travel.
Time has come for us to start the search for a special home for Tarzan.
This fellow is an interesting character that we have been working with since he entered our care from a pound in late October 2021. Then he was a reactive kitten that used his mouth and claws a lot with significant pressure.
Tarzan is an active, confident and playful boy that we suspect has some bengal bloodline in his DNA. Many of his ""wild child"" elements match with bengal behaviours.
Tarzan needs a committed home that is child free. A home that will do lots of mental stimulation but also establish and maintain clear boundaries and expectations. Tarzan can still be defensive and use his mouth and claws if he feels threatened, but with significantly less intensity. On the flip side Tarzan can be super sweet and affectionate. He loves to sleep with his human.
Tarzan is in foster care with dogs and cats. The other cats do tend to have low tolerance for his intensity in play.
Tarzan's estimated date of birth is 18 August 2021. His adoption fee is $250 and Tarzan goes to his carefully selected home flea and worm treated, vaccinated, desexed and microchipped.

Mr Biggles (also known as Lord Bigglesworth) is an utter utter utter bastard. He looks gorgeous with his slinky shiny black fur and big yellow eyes... but beware. If he doesn't like what you're doing he will give you a nip! Sometimes he likes to swipe at your feet too. It just depends on what he can reach at the time. 
Mr Biggles does not like to be thwarted. He throws a catty tantrum if he can't go outside when he wants to be let out (and he wasn't allowed outside for the first couple of weeks at his carers house so there was a few tantrums!). Not being fed on time, or allowed to strut across the kitchen benches helping himself to whatever is there is also a tantrum inducing exercise. 
Mr Biggles is a despot and dictator, he will let you know he is not happy, which is often because things are often just not up to his high standards. There is some warning that Lord Bigglesworth is displeased with you, his eyes will go dark and tail will start swishing harder. Mr Biggles likes his cuddles on his terms, and will sit in your lap when he decides it's time. If the stroking is not up to his standards, he will nip you. 
Shhhhh... Mr Biggles does have a secret soft side... he plays with kittens and actually does love a cuddle from time to time. He loves to be involved with what you're doing and loves to have a chat, he will respond if you talk to him. While he's not a fan of being picked up, likes a pat and cuddle from time to time and even permits kisses on his shiny black head if he's feeling mellow. He loves sleeping on the end of the humans bed, and in his cat bed (and he snores just a little bit, it's so cute). He loves to be out in the backyard stalking the chickens and supervising the gardening, and he has been saying playing with the dog (and not drawing blood).
And now I'm in trouble for telling his softie secrets so I have been ordered to say that Lord Bigglesworth believes he was put on this earth to be decorative and be worshipped by his human slaves!
PLEASE NOTE: Mr Biggles is not available for adoption, if you think he's a bastard normally he'd be 1000% worse after being stuck in quarantine for six months then on a plane. So we're not going to put anyone's lives at risk by doing that... Mr Biggles will be available for worship at his hissing booth which travels around cat shows and adoption days. Fans can write to him via humanslave@utterbastardcat.com with your missives of admiration or your own bastard / bitch cat stories (with pictures please!) and Mr Biggles will publish the ones he deems acceptable on his website utterbastardcat.com. Thank you everyone who has written to us about Mr Biggles, we are trying to respond to each and every one of you! 
STOP PRESS! Exclusive interview with Mr Biggles now available for viewing by his adoring public. Media requests and applications for slavery to Lord Bigglesworth can be sent to humanslave@utterbastardcat.com. Yes he has his own website, utterbastardcat.com. He'll be publishing more about his life, including ""stalking chickens 101"", ""how to play with a dog and not kill it"", ""getting what you want from human slaves"" and of course what's he's well known for...

She gave birth to her beautiful babies Cheddar, Camembert, Colby & Brie who have all gone to wonderful homes. Now its Halloumis turn to find her furever home.

She has been well socialised with a variety of other foster cats and kittens who she loves to chase and play with. Halloumi would be best suited to a house with another cat to play with. Halloumi would love to be a rodent operative, and murder mousies for you, in return for food and shelter and being decorative.

I am better now compared to what I was thanks to a rehab program I have been through but I still struggle with trust issues. I am what some people would call a Feral but really I am just a cat looking for my own very special person who would trust me and be patient with me.
I am not very cuddly yet but I have a good heart. I love other cats!!! I would love to have a brother or a sister to share the sunny afternoons with. I would let them play with all my toys and eat my food....
As for the human, it will take me a while to trust you but when I do, I will love you deeply and be loyal only to you. 
My foster mummy says it will take somebody just as stubborn as me to handle me. You, my special human, have to be kind and patient  with me and be willing to teach me how to be a cat.
I had to learn to accept pats and learn to meow like other cats but I'm still working on being picked up.
I can't ever be an outdoor cat again because I would quickly revert to my old ways, so please keep me inside and teach me what being a domestic cat is like.
My foster mommy is willing to teach you how to handle me if you are willing to give me your love, compassion and commitment. 
I need a calm house with no dogs or young children. If you're the person for me, submit an enquiry now!

Its not anything to do with you, I am timid around people, so I have to get to know you really really well before letting my guard down. Most people call me Mae for short and I like that, although I love my name Mabel, too! I do wear my little tuxedo coat with pride and once I get to know you I think I would like you to scratch and pat me. But sudden movements and loud noises scare me to bits, so I often run and hide. I have heard it said that I have a very sweet nature - it just takes me a very long time to get comfortable around people as Im often pretty afraid of them. I dont think Id be afraid of you though, especially if you make me feel safe and warm and comfortable. 
Do you have a kitty of your own who is looking for a playmate? I have an adopted brother who came in as a kitten and I love having the little one around. So if you have a little kitten at home who needs a companion like me that would be purrfect for all of us! I hope you can see that I am a lovely girl who just wants some love and tenderness from someone who understands that it may take me a while to come out of my shell. Are you my someone?

You know that meme? The one that says if you want to be judged and treated like nothing more than a feeding mechanism, play toy and general dogsbody? Look no further, these floofy sisters who were reincarnated from sassy 1920's flappers are here to make you feel as special as you are. Which to put it politely, you're their human servant and exist to pander to their every catty whim. 
Want to attack feet under the blankets at 11pm? 2am? 5am? scriff scruff here it comes, fun times!
Pull all the toys out of the toybox and spread throughout the house? Absolutely, the Fluff Sisters can do that. 
Smooch up to the resident tomcats and get groomed and admired? Yes... but don't you dare touch them with your monkey hands. Gods forbid! 
If you're really really really lucky they'll be snoozing together in their cat bed and will let you pet their adorable super soft floofy fur. But unless they're really relaxed, nope. They'll just look at you like you're the spawn of satan and run away.
Until it's breakfast or dinner, then you'll get THE LOOK. Until you feed them and then they leave you alone.
So that's the negative about the girls. 
Positives are: 
- They are no longer feral as all heck. That's right, they don't give you puncture wounds and bruises any more. 
- They do touch their noses to your finger to say hello. Greta is more confident, Sophie is still saucer eyed and convinced you're going to murder her. Maybe. 
- Can't lie, they are so cute and fun to watch when they romp around the house, play and chew cat grass, and generally hang out doing cat stuff.
- They love being on the bed. Especially when you're asleep. They're getting more confident by the day. 
- Their foster carer loves hearing their bells on their collars so they know where the sisters are, they play hide and seek. Usually the sisters hide, and the foster carer can't find them... ha! except when it's the couch, they're brave when there's a bit of furniture. 
Feel like a challenge? Ready to take on some flapper kittens with cattitude? Submit an enquiry now and learn how much your life will change for the cattier with the Fluff Sisters in it. Don't dilly dally, get onto it!

499,499,Bandido The Beastly!,Character Plus!,"Not Boring Bandit was a sweet affectation much loved indoor only family cat until one day he ran away from home. He was missing for over six months, and when he was found and returned (hooray for microchips!) the experience had changed him. He became aggressive and unpredictable and the family was no longer able to look after him.
Bandit was surrender to Cat People of Melbourne who have had him in care for almost a year. Our behavioural carers have worked with him, weve used vet recommended behavioural medications and they have helped but he would still be unpredictable at times. Then his carers discovered Bandit loved boxes. Boxes means Bandit is happy, he likes to sit in them, sleep in them, move around from box to box they work for him. And no medication side effects, ecologically sound (recyclable) and most importantly happy Bandit means happy people!
So we are looking for someone special to adopt or permanently foster Bandit. Whoever takes on this big boy needs to understand that sometimes PTSD happens and simply doesnt go away, no matter how much we love them. Hes a challenge but hes a big lovely one and we think hes worth it. Are you up for it?
PROS:
*Very affectionate
* very sweet
* Loves cuddles
* Likes to lick faces and hands
* LOVES BOXES!! Boxes make Bandit happy.
* Becoming more relaxed, and better at being handled/ confined to a section of the house.
Cons: * does not like other animals.
* cat run preferable
* can be aggressive towards humans.
* No kids allowed
* Can be territorial around doors
* fast reactions
* mood swings
* has the potential to also self harm

504,504,Caia,Smoochy & Sweet,"Meet Caia,
Being a single mum who was extremely loved by her previous family but then uprooted due to an unforeseen logistical move was not the most ideal start for our beautiful Caia aka Mumma C. 
Incredibly, Mumma C has never indicted any stress or anxiety since being in her foster carers home with her babies. She is nothing other than a very caring and attentive mum, but now its her turn. Caia has become a love-demanding, confident and smoochy young lady. She loves pats of all kinds, even belly rubs! She leads in for head rubs, loves being brushed and just needs the right lap to cuddle up on. Caia is friendly with people of all ages, but is not a fan of dogs or other male cats. We think she would thrive as the only feline in the home. 
Her foster carer is almost certain she was strictly an outdoor cat prior to coming to Foster Kittens of Melbourne so ideally for Caia, an outdoor caged cat run or supervised time on a cat harness would make her extremely happy a few times a week. Other then that, a warm cat bed and a spot next to you on the couch will make her purrs soar.

I can be a little bit shy and reserved with strangers but once I get to know you I will show you my super playful and affectionate nature!
I my previous home I had never met another animal before so I am not okay being around cats or dogs so my new family will need to make sure that I am the only pet in the home.
I would be best around children who are over the age of 10 and can be quieter around me and help me to build up my confidence whilst I settle into my new home.
If you would like to come and meet me please call BARC on (03) 5441 2209 to make a booking.

I am an older lady appox over 6 years of age, I love to socialise and being the centre of attention with the shelter staff. I really do not like other cats so I will need to be the only queen of the house.
I occasionally give love bites, so I would be best not around small children either.
My favourite playtime activity to do is running through the tunnels the staff set up chasing the streamers. 
My favourite food is black hawk dry food and I love nibbling on the shredded chicken the staff share with me at lunch time. 
I enjoy long naps, especially by myself in a warm sunny spot.

She has made it clear to her foster carers that she is used to being treated like a Queen and will have it no other way. 
As you can see in the pictures, she previously had a glorious coat to match her attitude, but due to some matting it has to be all removed! Cphyr will need her coat shaved possibly twice yearly to keep her fur a manageable length for her. (Her fur grows so long and fine that through self-grooming she can consume enough to create massive furballs!) 
As a result of her recent shave she is looking a bit silly at the moment, but she knows that Cattitude is the most important attribute!
She is endlessly affectionate and very loyal, she and will follow her foster carer into every room of the house and try to curl up beside her humans constantly.
She is also very playful, when she has had enough patting she will give you one gentle smack which is her instruction to provide her with toys she can bat around the room or try to pull from your hands. 
It is recommended that she goes to a home without children, as when she is upset you only get one warning. 
She has previously lived with a large dog, but may take some time to get used to them. She is still a bit wary of the dogs she is currently in foster care with.

I am incredibly clever and have learned multiple voice commands, although I tend to pay attention only when I'm indoors - when I'm outside, my wild side tends to come out. This leaves me easily distracted from humans and prone to pounce off, although I will come in eventually! I have been living indoors and outdoors, so somewhere with a secure backyard enclosure would be ace! I enjoy being able to roam outside. I will need time to transition from the old territory to my new home when I move, so it is required to keep me indoors for some time before considering letting me outside. I'm loud and I'll tell you if I'm hungry, want to come in or out, or want to play so I hope you don't mind if I'm a little opinionated!
I tend to be wary of strangers approaching and will likely run away, although I'm happy to watch from a distance and let you take gorgeous photos to share with your friends.

519,519,Special Needs & Beautiful - Vuitton & Lilly <3,"Deaf, Wobbly, & Shy <3","Lilly and Vuitton are stunning young girls who have bonded in their foster home and become wonderful supports for each other's special needs. They are the perfect pair for a working couple with no current pets, maybe in an apartment or townhouse where the girls will be kept indoors and adored for their uniqueness. They are sure to complete your home and bring much love and laughter to your evenings :D
Both girls love to run around chasing toys and climbing their cat tree. Being unable to hear where anyone is as she's deaf, Lilly gets upset if she thinks she's been left alone and will cry out. Vuitton is great to ease her stress as she keeps Lilly company, and in turn Lilly's outgoing nature helps shy Vuitton learn the confidence she needs. Please read about the girl's unique needs below and contact us if you fit the home described above, please note we won't be accepting applications from homes with other pets or young children <3
 Lilly
Nine month old Lilly is deaf and has a condition called Cerebellar Hypoplasia which is essentially the wobbles, she wobbles in everything she does :D  CH is a developmental condition in which the cerebellum - the portion of the brain that controls fine motor skills, balance, and coordination - fails to develop properly and the result is a bit of a wobbly body. The condition is not painful or contagious - Lilly will live a normal cat life! She loves human company and loves to follow you around the house watching whatever you're up to. 
 Vuitton
Six month old Vuitton is a sweet little girl who loves a cuddle and to be held firmly making her feel safe, as she was a found alone as a wild born kitten. Once she knows you she loves to sit on your lap, and adores toys and her cat tree. She is timid with new people and will need time to settle into her new home which will likely take weeks not days, so her new family will need to have patience - please don't enquire if you aren't willing to support Vuitton over a series of weeks for her to get to know you, your home and build the confidence she's shown in foster care.
If you think you have the right home and love for this beautiful pair send us an enquiry with a little about your family, lifestyle and home :D
*** PLEASE NOTE OUR INDOOR CAT POLICY
We have a strict indoor cat only policy and this is especially important for Lilly because she's deaf and would not be able to protect herself from harm, and for Vuitton as being timid she would be terrified if let outside and would be impossible to find again. Please consider this before making an enquiry.

Annaleise and her babies were very malnourished when they arrived and have benefited from being in a warm home with nutritious food. Annaleise has been an incredible mumma to her little ones, but raising 7 babies has taken its toll on her slender body. She is getting a bit fed up now with having her terrors jumping all over her and biting her tail  and is in desperate need of some TLC that she can only get by being in a home of her own with the attention all on her. 
Having lived on the street for most of her life she is understandably a bit nervous of loud noises and wary of strangers, but she trusts quickly and will be totally devoted to the person or people who show her kindness and love once she knows she can trust you. She is very very sweet and deserves the very best home  
Annaleise has not been tested with other cats or dogs and we would prefer that she go to a home as a solo cat to begin with so all the attention can go on her. A disinterested and gentle dog might be OK if they are willing to let her come to them in her own time.

I'm fairly independent for a cat, however, I won't ever let you forget that I am present - and my meows will just get louder until I get what I want.

I can be won over with food and treats, but don't you dare say anything about it affecting my weight! I'd prefer my human hosts to be adults, as I don't feel all that comfortable around small, young humans - it's not personal, I just don't get along or cope in environments with young humans.

563,563,Rocky and Eevee,Double love,"Rocky (Big dark floof) and Eevee (little white floof) were surrendered as their owner could no longer care for them.
They are the sweetest couple of Kitties. They are domesticated, well-behaved and have the most beautiful little relationship with each other.
Let's start with the boss, Eevee. Whilst much smaller than Rocky, she's the one in charge. She's a cuddly little girl who loves to flip and flop in your arms and needs a good cuddle at least once a day. If you've been away for a while, you'll need to make up for it with more cuddles. She'll let you know how much she's missed you with endless head bumps and wet nose kisses all over your face. She's food-motivated, likes a good nap and enjoys a good rumble and play with Rocky daily.
Rocky is a dopey, hilarious and an extremely playful funny boy. He is mad about his wand and loves to play soccer, fetch or anything at all. He has a disproportionately baby meow that sounds like it can't possibly come out of a cat as regal as he is. He has the most beautiful multishade green eyes you've ever seen. If not playing, he'll follow you around the house and help with daily chores or gaze out the window trying to spot birds and moths. He always looks surprised and is easily frightened but learns fast and comes out of hiding more the better he gets to know you. Whilst not much of a lap cat, he's very interactive and playful and will come around to lounge with you on his own terms. He also loves a good chin rub.
These guys are really well behaved - they've never scratched any furniture (I have a few scratching posts and toys around), they don't chew on anything, they deal well with having their nails trimmed, they don't howl and they're really friendly with other cats.
They're pretty scared of dogs in the one interaction they've had but they would likely be ok with casual visits from a dog friend. Rocky in particular doesn't seem very street smart so they would be best suited to an indoor lifestyle. They love each other so much and they've shown so much love in their foster homes. Watching one of their daily boxing matches has become a great source of amusement through lockdowns. If you can give them a home, you'll have a lot of affection, a lot of entertainment and a lot of great company for years to come.",Male,Domestic Long Hair Cat,MEOW Rescue,"Port Melbourne, VIC",Long,"18 Dec, 2021",320,47.0,Doesn't have dogs| Doesn't have kids under 5

Keith is a playful but cautious boy. Living on the streets, Keith has not been privileged to be a kitten, now he has the time to explore his inner kitten and loves to play with a ball, ribbons, mouse toy, and his scratcher. 
Keith is super super affectionate, he meows and chirps for attention and will paw your hand if he's not getting the attention, he just wants the contact and connection. Sometimes he will give a gentle love bite, mostly to get attention, but sometimes to say to stop. He doesn't ever draw blood so he knows what he's doing. 
Keith has relaxed, he shows this via his purr and drools and wants to spend time on your lap.  Keith is still learning to be picked up, he can be picked up from the floor to couch, we are working on higher lifts. 
Keith is a little wary of the washer or vacuum, he will hide and sometimes meows loudly to show his concern, he does calm down after a while. Keith loves to connect and would suit a home where can bond with his new person, sleep on the chest, lap, and bed.

I was transferred to RSPCA Peninsula from South Australia and I have no prior history.
I am an independent cat who occasionally likes a good pat and I like to play with ping pong balls, I'm surprisingly quick for my age. My favourite thing to do is to people watch and bird watch through the window. I have non-pigmented skin and skin damage so I must stay indoors to prevent any further skin damage caused by the sun. 
I am a relaxed chic who needs a relaxed home, no young children please. I can get a bit jealous of other cats so I'd prefer to be the only pet but if I have to share, I may be ok sharing my house with another independent senior cat.

570,570,Bubbie,Super Snuggly!,"Why, hello!
It's a pleasure to meet you! My name is Bubbie, and I am the biggest smooch that has ever walked the planet!
I didn't have the easiest start in life. I was born on the streets, and spent the first several months of my life, being fed by a lovely lady, that made sure I was well fed (and boy, did she do a good job at it!! My foster carer and vet said I was a bit too much of a good eater, and needed to lose some weight!), and slowly getting me used to human interaction. She was very gentle with me and my mummy, and when she thought we were ready, she reached out to the rescue to help get me on my next adventure! I spent a few months in foster care, learning some house manners, and gaining some confidence, but now I am ready to find my furever home! 
I LOVE, LOVE, LOVE smoochies! I am a massive head-butt smoocher, and will get under your feet and legs for pats and attention, so will prefer a home where I wont accidentally get stood on, or cause someone to fall over! I like to have time to myself, and would prefer a quieter home, where I can do my own thing as well; a busy or loud home may be a bit too much for me, after being on the streets for a while. I get along with all kinds of animals, provided they aren't too boisterous, or will want to smack me in the face! There was this one foster cat I shared a home with, she was THE BOSS, and she liked to bop me across the face with a paw every now and then, and I didn't know what to do! I just ran to my humans for cuddles! She was so scary! I'm more of a lover, than a fighter, so if another cat tries to scare me, I will just push my ears back and run away! I have met a few other cats and kittens that I have been friends with, and even a crazy bunny, and some friendly dogs! But I don't think I will do too well with children. I cant really predict them, and they are usually too loud and sticky, so would prefer a home with no young kids.
I was a brave little man when I got desexed, I had the whole vet clinic giving me cuddles and smooches, and feeling sorry for me, after my very traumatic experience! How do other cats go through this?! Even just the car ride there was scary! Did I mention I was a bit of a sookie baby? That's how I got my name! It probably wasn't traumatic or scary at all, but that's not what I told my foster mummy when I got home! I told her ALLLL about it, and made sure there were extra treats and cuddles!
If you think that you could be a lovely home for me, and have the time to give me my required cuddles and treats daily, feel free to get in contact with Fin, Furred N Feathered, to organise a meet and greet with me! Just a warning, a may be a little shy the first time you meet me, but if you bring tasty treats, I should warm up to you very quickly!!

571,571,Miss Tiger,Quiet Dainty Little Lady,"Well hello, its a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I'm Miss Tiger. And you are? (Hopefully my new forever home...)
I was surrendered over to Fin, Furred n Feathered, after my owners decided that my living environment was probably too much for me. I came from a very busy and loud household, and it was a little too much for me to have to deal with. I like the finer, quieter things in life. A lady cat is a very delicate being! 
I am a very sweet and affectionate girl, but I REALLY don't like sharing my humans. I want them all to myself. Is that unreasonable to ask for? My current foster mummy keeps telling me that the dogs are ok, and I suppose these ones are, they respect my privacy, and I think I have the little one scared. She keeps telling me that they wont hurt me, but have you seen the hygiene of dogs?! They eat poop! And they ALWAYS smell! And she expects me to like sharing a couch with them?! I mean, I wont say no to human snuggles on the couch, but I WILL make it known that I think the dogs are gross and inferior when they are next to me...
Cats on the other hand, well they scare me! They have claws and teeth and they growl and hiss! Oh heavens, its too much just thinking about being near another cat!! So I would prefer my new owner to not have any other animals, but definitely no cats! I mean, maybe I could allow a rabbit or a chicken or something, but I don't think I was made to live with other cats. I have standards, and they don't cut the mustard!
I am a sweet quiet little girl. You would barely even notice I'm around! I do love a human cuddle, and I wont lie, I WILL drool when I'm purring. Its my only unlady-like quality! Otherwise, I promise I have the best hygiene! I clean myself, use my toilet tray perfectly, don't shed much, and don't make a mess of my food or water! Speaking of food, I did have some lovely dental work done when I was surrendered, so would need to make sure my new humans will continue to look after my pearly whites.

572,572,Emmy,A total smooch!,"Hey There! Yeah, you! I see you looking at my picture and thinking about how gorgeous I look. Don't worry, I know! My name is Emmy, and I'm an absolute stunner of a boy! Personality +++! If you cant tell...
I was handed in to a vet clinic when I was found wandering the streets, all alone, cold and hungry. But it turns out, I had been searching for my home for several years!!! I had been missing for 4 YEARS!! My previous owners didn't think they would ever see me again, so they adopted some other fur family members to look after them and keep them company, whilst I wasn't there. They didn't think that I would like the new family members too much, so made the heartbreaking decision to surrender me over to Fin, Furred N Feathered.
But don't let my sad story make you feel sorry for me! I see this as an opportunity to meet my next forever family, and maybe along the way meet some nice people, get some extra smooches, and hopefully treats! Treats and food are my favourite things (besides people that is!). I like to pretend that I haven't been fed, so I can score some extra food! Humans are so easy to trick! I almost feel sorry for them...Unfortunately, it does mean that when my humans are looking for me, all they have to do is shake the food bag, and I come RUNNING! One day this will no doubt get me in trouble, but for now, Ill never say no to extra snacks! 
I love nothing more than a nice sunny spot, or perhaps your favourite spot on the couch, I'm not fussy. If you are sitting there, I guess I will have to annoy you for some cuddles! Warning, when I'm happy purring, I can sometimes drool....
I would prefer to be re-homed with no other cats, as I did spend several years on the street, defending my territory, trying to get the best morsels of food! I Don't want to have to do that in my own home too. I don't seem to mind dogs, but would prefer the kind that aren't going to chase me around the house, or annoy me til all hours of the day! They cant interrupt my precious sleep patterns! An Old Man needs his beauty sleep!! I'm great with kids of all ages, I tend to find they give me the BEST cuddles, and more attention than I know what to do with, but I'm not complaining! They are also better at tricking in to giving me snacks....
It would be great if my new home could make sure that I am an indoor only cat, or with a fully secure outdoor cat enclosure, as the last thing I want, is to wander off, and spend the next 4 years trying to work out my way back home again! I'm clearly not great with directions...
I might ask you to go out, but please, be strong, you are the human, I'm just the humble old man cat. My current humans tell me that I'll get used to being indoors, and that its safer for me, and blah blah blah... I'm sure they are right, but I'll never tell them that!
I'm currently in foster care with an amazing family, that are spoiling me rotten, but am super keen to see what my future holds! If you are interested in meeting me, or want any more information, feel free to fill out an adoption form, or send the lovely team at Fin, Furred N Feathered an email to get more info! 
Cant wait to meet you!
PS: Bring snacks...

Honey has been let down by humans and ended up stucked at a rural pound .
She wasn't coping at a pound we don't blame her . But Her time was up , and no one came for her rescue . 
Honey reminded us so much of Neo and Raven, 2 pound brothers stucked at a rural pound in NSW 10 weeks ago roughly...and arrived to us very scared, with existing medical needs and past human trauma. Both are now back to their happy self  Neo has been adopted after 8 weeks of TLC with one of our foster . Raven is now ready for adoption after 10 weeks staying with our group founder.
So it's fair to say when we saw Honey we felt strongly for her and felt she deserve to live a life of happiness and joy like any other loved cats , co-exisiting with humans again, without fear/feeling petrified . No animal should feel that they have no place amongst us! They should not feel threatened by humans & unable to feel safe around us.
WE URGENTLY NEED A FOSTER or FOSTER TO ADOPT for Honey please  so she can start her healing journey whilst being allowed decompressing time at her own pace. *she is not aggressive,  will need her own space until she is ready to mingle at her own pace*
As always fostering means the world for animals like Honey, without foster environment she won't have a chance for a happy full life. Well without a foster she won't have a 2nd chance.
Fostering with us means we provide everything for you to foster our animal.
Honey's vet work is done and she is healthy .
She is very good with her litter box , neat little lady, ate well, prefer dry food only.

I havent met any young children but I would prefer a quieter household where I can grow and become comfortable with my new family. I currently live with another cat who I dont mind sharing my room with. I would be fine with another easy going, laid back cat.
I dont seem too fussed by dogs as long as they keep to themselves and we are slowly introduced. 
I dont mind spending time by myself gazing out the window and sleeping on my favourite cat tree or cat cave. I'm not very interested in toys but enjoy watching my foster sister chasing her toy mouse around.

PLEASE NOTE:  Due to our cats being previously stray and rescued from struggling to survive on the street, we have a strict NO CATS OUTDOORS policy.  This is because although our cats have been rehabilitated from their past, their brain still retains fear towards 'outside',  as living wild was only ever scary to them, they are not the same as domestic cats who've grown up in human homes since kittenhood.  This is important to keep in mind if you were hoping to adopt from us and have your adopted cat living inside and outside, or even just with supervised time outside, as unfortunately it won't be possible.  Please consider this before making an enquiry.

Aree came to us after being put on the euthanasia list at a rural pound, a list which was luckily sent out to rescue orgs and we were able to fit her in. She spent some time in our rehab centre getting used to humans, and then in foster care where the she was adored and almost adopted but one of the existing cats was determined not to like her and nothing the humans did fixed this. So she was moved to where she is now and recently actually adopted, but not given time to adapt to the change and was returned for not bonding with her adopter fast enough :(
So she's been loved but also not loved, and we're really sad for her. She just needs her own special person and home and we know that's out there for her!
Aree loves a pat and a cuddle (if given the chance to settle in as stated above) and is very sweet and attentive. She's also playful - she loves playing with wand toys, balls and laser pointers - but also enjoys snoozing as all cats do. And she loves food!
Don't miss out on this darling girl, she's going to make someone very happy if given the chance to get to know her <3 :) <3
 
*** PLEASE NOTE OUR INDOOR CAT POLICY 
Most of our cats were either born, or lived for some time, on the street and have only ever known the outside world to be a source of fear and survival of the fittest.  So although they've been rehabilitated and are in most ways domesticated by adoption, they will 100% return to fearful behaviour if let outside.  Hence we have an indoor only policy (or indoor with access to an enclosure, netted area or leash walking) unless clearly stated in an individual cat's profile.

Miss Anabella is quite the sweet lass, who was more interested in exploring and smooching than posing for her photo shoot. Anabella would be best suited to a home without small children as sudden movements and loud noises may startle her. She will make a lovely companion for someone who is looking for an affectionate cat. Anabella would prefer to be the only cat in the household so she can be the sole recipient of her family's attentions and affection. 
After going missing for a while Anabella did come into the shelter with some hair loss from an unidentified allergy. She has been treated for this and is well on the way to regrowing all her hair. As the source is unknown this condition may reoccur in the future but don't let that deter you from giving this sweet lass a loving home.
Anabella is currently being treated for Cat Flu. Although this condition usually resolves without complications, in some instances the cat may remain a carrier of this disease and the disease may recur in the future.",Female,Domestic Short Hair Mix Cat,Campaspe Animal Shelter,"Echuca, VIC",Short,"29 Dec, 2021",25.00,51.0,

I am a HUGE purr machine, and love nothing more than to sit on your lap or in your arms and steal all the chin scratches and head tickles you'll offer. I also accept belly rubs, and back massages as payment for being your pet. 
I may meow at strange times of the night, but I am only looking for you! 
I may not hear you straight away and you may have to yell a bit louder, but I promise I don't mean it.

I'm a sweet girl with no aggression whatsoever. I enjoy your company but I don't like pat's. I'm very settled and calm being inside, lazing in the sun, on your bed or on the couch. I'll sit opposite you and watch tv with you, but if you try and touch me I will run away. I am not scared when you walk right past me, you could practically step over me and I won't move, I'm just not a big fan of pats.
I'd love a home where there are no kids trying to get to me, but I would love a kitty friend. I've been with my foster mum for the past few months, helping her take in any other foster kitties needing companionship. I love to take them under my paw and show them how good life is with a family and the importance of a little mischief. I have spent time around a puppy, and don't mind small breed dogs, but large dogs frighten me.
I'm very interested in what's going on outside and would love the opportunity to explore the outside world but have a loving warm home to come to. I will approach you for food, and if it smells good I'll eat it off your finger. I am a very clean pussy cat, I don't like a mess or spreading kitty litter around the place. I will make a toy out of anything chase, tug, bat it across the floor for fun. I like to sit on top of things such as cat enclosures and crates.

I promise I'm a pleasure to be around, I just need someone to take the leap of faith with me. If I seem like I could be a fit for you and/or your family please express your interest! I'll be waiting.

My favourite things are naps, bird watching, brushing and chin scratches! Although I'm no spring chicken, I love  playing around the scratching post and the tunnel, and I also love a snuggle in the evenings!
I'll need a quiet, library-like home, preferably with adults or possibly older teenagers that will be gentle with me. I have never been around young kids or any other animals, so I get scared of loud noises and I really would prefer to have all your attention to myself and not share with other pets.

At the beginning all I wanted to do was hide but they slowly built my confidence and trust. They showed me how wonderful it feels to be patted and gently brushed.
Sometimes I forget how much I enjoy this and will run away from you, but if you are patient and wrap a soft blanket around me I feel much more secure and will let you pat me. 
My foster family tell me that I am a really lovely cat, and in the right conditions would absolutely thrive. I need someone who is patient
and quiet, and is willing to invest many months into me. If they do, they will have a really beautiful cat who is very kind natured.
I will need a very quiet, calm and predictable home. Older cat savvy teenagers (15+) might be ok but but I am not suited to live with young children. 
I will feel much more comfortable in a indoor only home and I would like to be the only pet in my home so that my new family can focus on continuing to build my trust. I might never be an outgoing and confident cat. But you will be rewarded as I learn to trust you and form a lasting bond.

637,637,Eevee and Rocky,Double love,"Rocky (Big dark floof) and Eevee (little white floof) were surrendered as their owner could no longer care for them.
They are the sweetest couple of Kitties. They are domesticated, well-behaved and have the most beautiful little relationship with each other. 
Let's start with the boss, Eevee. Whilst much smaller than Rocky, she's the one in charge. She's a cuddly little girl who loves to flip and flop in your arms and needs a good cuddle at least once a day. If you've been away for a while, you'll need to make up for it with more cuddles. She'll let you know how much she's missed you with endless head bumps and wet nose kisses all over your face. She's food-motivated, likes a good nap and enjoys a good rumble and play with Rocky daily.
Rocky is a dopey, hilarious and an extremely playful funny boy. He is mad about his wand and loves to play soccer, fetch or anything at all. He has a disproportionately baby meow that sounds like it can't possibly come out of a cat as regal as he is. He has the most beautiful multishade green eyes you've ever seen. If not playing, he'll follow you around the house and help with daily chores or gaze out the window trying to spot birds and moths. He always looks surprised and is easily frightened but learns fast and comes out of hiding more the better he gets to know you. Whilst not much of a lap cat, he's very interactive and playful and will come around to lounge with you on his own terms. He also loves a good chin rub. 
These guys are really well behaved - they've never scratched any furniture (I have a few scratching posts and toys around), they don't chew on anything, they deal well with having their nails trimmed, they don't howl and they're really friendly with other cats. 
They're pretty scared of dogs in the one interaction they've had but they would likely be ok with casual visits from a dog friend. Rocky in particular doesn't seem very street smart so they would be best suited to an indoor lifestyle. They love each other so much and they've shown so much love in their foster homes. Watching one of their daily boxing matches has become a great source of amusement through lockdowns. If you can give them a home, you'll have a lot of affection, a lot of entertainment and a lot of great company for years to come.",Female,Domestic Short Hair Cat,MEOW Rescue,"Port Melbourne, VIC",Short,"18 Dec, 2021",320,47.0,Doesn't have dogs| Doesn't have kids under 5

She has passed all health checks to go home. She would prefer to be the queen of her own castle and isn't super fond of dogs. Scully does not enjoy being picked up, so no small children please.

Due to my shy nature I prefer a quieter home with mainly adult and maybe one or two calm teens that will be understanding of my needs.
It can be quite overwhelming just adjusting to a new home, let alone other pets as well. for this reason I would like to be an only pet in my new home at this stage.

647,647,Wallace,Love bug,"Wallace had a rough start to life, left to fend for himself on the streets. He had made a home for himself under a bridge. You might think living this life, that wallace would be unsoclalised or nervous. As did we when we took this big boy into care. At first we assumed he was shy and maybe even agressive if he'd been unhandled.
We couldn't have been more wrong. Wallace is a big gentle giant. He's nothing but a love bug. He loves a pat, loves to spoon and ever so quietly loves to creep into bed with his foster human. He's calm and loves a quiet house preferably with no young children. Wallace loves people yet is independent and happy with his own company, and doesn't mind being an only cat. Unfortunately due to his previous life on the street, wallace would have been picked on by other cats. As a result he is fiv positive. This means that he must be an indoor and only cat. Wallace is used being able to wander where he likes as a stray. So to transition him into full time indoor living for life, a house or large unit/town house would be the perfect retirement from the streets. A cat run would be a bonus for him to get his daily vitamin d and watch the world he used to know.
